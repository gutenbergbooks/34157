  <p><i>So great a number of Treatises of Surgery, as well Ancient as
  Modern, have been already publish'd, that a plenary Satisfaction seems to
  have been long since given on this Subject, even to the Judgment of the
  most curious Inquirers: But if it be consider'd that a young Surgeon
  ought always to have in view the first Principles of this Noble Art
  explain'd after a familiar and intelligible manner, it will be soon
  acknowledg'd that there is good reason to set about</i> <i>the Work anew:
  For besides that the Writings of the Ancients being so voluminous, are
  not portable, they are also very intricate and confus'd; nay the whole
  Art has been so far improv'd and brought to perfection by able Masters in
  the present Age, that they are now almost become unprofitable.</i></p>

  <p><i>Some Modern authors have set forth certain small Tracts, which only
  explain a few Chirurgical Operations, and on that account deserve only
  the Name of Fragments. Indeed the Works of some others seem to be
  sufficiently compleat, but are printed in so large Volumes, and contain
  so many Discourses altogether foreign from the principal Subject, that
  they have almost the same Inconveniences with those of the Ancients.
  Therefore the Reader is here presented with a small Treatise of Surgery,
  yet very plain and perspicuous, in a portable Volume; being free from a
  Multiplicity of impertinent Words, and containing every thing of moment
  that has been producd by the most approv'd Authors both Ancient and
  Modern.</i></p>

  <p><i>An Introduction is made into the Matter by small Colloquies or
  Dialogues, to the end that the young Student may be at first lead as it
  were by the Hand; but as soon as he has attain'd to a considerable
  Progress in these Studies, this innocent and puerile manner of speaking
  is abandon'd, to conduct him in good earnest to the most sublime Heights
  of so admirable an Art; to which purpose, after having penetrated into
  its first Rudiments and Grounds, he is well instructed in Anatomy, and
  furnish'd with a general </i>Idea<i> of Wounds and Tumours, which are
  afterward treated of in particular: He is also taught a good Method of
  curing Wounds made by Gun-shot, the Scurvy, and all sorts of Venereal
  Diseases: From thence he is introduced into the Practice of all manner of
  Chirurgical Operations in Fractures and Luxations; together with the use
  of their respective Dressings and Bandages.</i></p>

  <p><i>At the end of the Work is added a </i>compleat Chirurgical
  Dispensatory<i>, shewing the Method of preparing such Medicinal
  Compositions as are chiefly us'd in the Art of Surgery; so that upon the
  whole Matter, it may be justly affirm'd, that this little Manual has all
  the Advantages of the Ancient and Modern Writings on the same Subject,
  and is altogether free from their Superfluities and Defects.</i></p>

  <p>A Person skill'd in curing Diseases incident to Humane Bodies by a
  methodical Application of the Hand.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Qualifications of a good Surgeon in general?</i></p>

<p><!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span></p>

  <p>They are three in Number: <i>viz.</i> Skill in the Theory, Experience
  in the Practical part, and a gentle Application of the Hand.</p>

  <p><i>Why ought a Surgeon to be skilful?</i></p>

  <p>Because without a discerning Faculty he can have no certainty in what
  he doth.</p>

  <p><i>Why must he be experienc'd?</i></p>

  <p>Because Knowledge alone doth not endue him with a dexterity of Hand
  requisite in such a Person, which cannot be acquir'd but by Experience,
  and repeated Manual Operations.</p>

  <p><i>Why must he be tender-handed?</i></p>

  <p>To the End that by fit Applications he may asswage those Pains which
  he is oblig'd to cause his Patients to endure.</p>

  <p><i>What is Chirurgery or Surgery?</i></p>

  <p>It is an Art which shews how to cure the Diseases of Humane Bodies by
  a methodical Manual Application. The Term being derived from the
  <i>Greek</i> Word <span title="Cheir" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&epsilon;&#x1F76;&rho;</span>, signifying a Hand and <span
  title="Ergon" class="grk">&#x1F1C;&rho;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;</span>, a
  <i>Work</i> or <i>Operation</i>.</p>

  <p><i>After how many manners are Chirurgical Operations usually
  perform'd?</i></p>

  <p>Four several ways.</p>

  <p><i>Which be they?</i></p>

  <p>I. <i>Synthesis</i>, whereby the divided Parts are re-united; as in
  Wounds. II. <i>Diæresis</i>, that divides and separates those Parts,
  which, by their Union, hinder the Cure of Diseases, such is the
  continuity of Abscesses or Impostumes which must be open'd to let out the
  purulent Matter. III. <i>Exæresis</i>, which draws out of the Body
  whatsoever is noxious or hurtful, as Bullets, Arrows, <i>&amp;c.</i> IV.
  <i>Prosthesis</i> adds some Instrument or Body to supply <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>the defect of
  those that are wanting; such are Artificial Legs and Arms, when the
  Natural ones are lost. It also furnishes us with certain Instruments to
  help and strengthen weak Parts, such as <i>Pessaries</i>, which retain
  the <i>Matrix</i> in its proper place when it is fallen, Crutches to
  assist feeble Persons in going, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>What ought to be chiefly observed before the undertaking an
  Operation?</i></p>

  <p>Four things; <i>viz.</i> 1. What the Operation to be perform'd is? 2.
  Why it is perform'd? 3. Whether it be necessary or possible? And 4. The
  manner of performing it.</p>

  <p><i>How may we discern these?</i></p>

  <p>The Operation to be perform'd may be known by its Definition; that is
  to say, by explaining what it is in it self: We may discover whether it
  ought to be done, by examining whether the Distemper cannot be cur'd
  otherwise: We may also judge whether it be possible or necessary, by a
  competent Knowledge of the Nature of the Disease, the Strength of the
  Patient, and the Part affected: Lastly, the manner of performing it may
  be found out, by being well vers'd in the Practice of Surgery.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Fundamental Principles of Surgery?</i></p>

  <p>They are Three in number: <i>viz.</i> 1. The knowledge of Man's Body.
  2. That of the Diseases which require a Manual Operation. 3. That of
  proper Remedies and Helps upon every Occasion.</p>

  <p><i>How may one attain to the Knowledge of Humane Bodies?</i> <!-- Page
  4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span></p>

  <p>By the study of Anatomy.</p>

  <p><i>How may one learn to know the Distempers relating to Surgery, and
  the Remedies appropriated for them?</i></p>

  <p>Two several ways; <i>viz.</i> 1. By the reading of good Books, and
  Instructions receiv'd from able Masters of that Art. 2. By practice and
  the Observation of what is perform'd by others upon the Bodies of their
  Patients.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Diseases in general that belong to Surgery?</i></p>

  <p>They are Tumours, Impostumes, Wounds, Ulcers, Fractures, Dislocations,
  and generally all sorts of Distempers whereto Manual Operations may be
  applyed.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Instruments in general which are commonly used in
  Surgery for the curing of Diseases?</i></p>

  <p>They are Five; <i>viz.</i> the Hand, Bandages, Medicines, the
  Incision-Knife, and Fire.</p>

  <p><i>What is the general Practice which ought to be observ'd in the
  Application of these different helps?</i></p>

  <p><i>Hippocrates</i> teacheth us, in saying, that when Medicines are not
  sufficient, recourse may be had to the Incision-Knife, and afterward to
  Fire; intimating that we must proceed by degrees.</p>

  <p><i>Are there any Distempers that may be cured by the Surgeon's Hand
  alone?</i></p>

  <p>Yes, as when a simple and small Dislocation is only to be reduced.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> II.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Chirurgical Instruments, portable and
not portable.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What do you call portable and not portable Instruments?</i></p>

  <p>Portable Instruments are those which the Surgeon carries in his
  Lancet-Case with his Plaister-Box; and not portable are those that he
  doth not carry about him, but is oblig'd to keep at home; the former
  being appointed for the ready help which he daily administers to his
  Patients, and the others for greater Operations.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Instruments which a Surgeon ought to have in his
  Plaister-Box?</i></p>

  <p>These Instruments are a good pair of <i>Sizzers</i>, a <i>Razor</i>,
  an <i>Incision-Knife</i> streight and crooked, a <i>Spatula</i>, a
  greater <i>Lancet</i> to open Impostumes, and lesser for letting Blood.
  They likewise carry separately in very neat Lancet-Cases, a hollow
  <i>Probe</i> made of Silver or fine Steel; as also many other Probes,
  streight, crooked, folding, and of different thickness; a <i>Pipe</i> of
  Silver or fine Steel, to convey the cauterizing <i>Button</i> to a remote
  Part, without running the hazard of burning those that are near it;
  another <i>Pipe</i> or <i>Tube</i> serving instead of a Case for
  <i>Needles</i>, which have Eyes at one end for sowing; a <i>Carlet</i>,
  or thick triangular Needle; a small <i>File</i>; a Steel Instrument to
  cleanse the Teeth; a <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span><i>Fleam</i>; a pair of crooked <i>Forceps</i>
  to draw a Tooth; a <i>Pelican</i>; a <i>Crow's Bill</i>; several sorts of
  <i>Raspatories</i>; a <i>Hook</i> to hold up the Skin in cutting,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>What are the Instruments which a Surgeon ought to keep in his
  Repository to perform the greater Operations?</i></p>

  <p>Some of them are peculiar to certain Operations, and others are common
  to all. The Instruments appropriated to particular Operations, are the
  <i>Trepan</i> for opening the Bones in the Head, or elsewhere: The
  <i>Catheters</i> or Probes for Men and Women afflicted with the Stone, or
  difficulty of making Water. <i>Extractors</i>, to lay hold on the Stone
  in <i>Lithotomy</i>, and to gather together the Gravel; large crooked
  <i>Incision-Knives</i>, and a <i>Saw</i>, to make Amputations of the Arms
  or Legs; great <i>Needles</i> with three Edges, to be used in making
  <i>Setons</i>; small <i>Needles</i> to couch Cataracts; other
  <i>Needles</i>; thin <i>Plates</i> and <i>Buckles</i> to close a
  Hair-Lip, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>May not the Salvatory be reckon'd among the portable
  Instruments?</i></p>

  <p>Yes, because the Balsams, Ointments, and Plaisters contain'd therein,
  are means whereof the Surgeon makes use to restore Health.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> III.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Anatomy in general; and in particular
of all the Parts whereof the
Humane Body is compos'd.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is Anatomy?</i></p>

  <p>It is the <i>Analysis</i> or exact Division of all the Parts of a
  Body, to discover their Nature and Original.</p>

  <p><i>What is requisite to be observ'd by a Surgeon before he goes about
  to dissect a Body?</i></p>

  <p>Two things; <i>viz.</i> The external Structure of the Body, and the
  Proportion or Correspondence between the outward Parts, and those that
  are within.</p>

  <p><i>Why so?</i></p>

  <p>Because without this exterior and general Knowledge, the Surgeon wou'd
  be often mistaken in the Judgment he is to pass concerning a Dislocation
  or Wound, inasmuch as it is by the Deformity which he perceives in the
  Member, that he knows the Dislocation, as it is also by the means of the
  Correspondence which the outward Parts have with the inward, that he is
  enabled to draw any certain Consequences relating to a Wound, which
  penetrates into the Body.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Part?</i></p>

  <p>It is that whereof the whole Body is compos'd, and which partakes of a
  common Life or Sensation with it. <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span></p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Parts are there in a Humane Body?</i></p>

  <p>We may well reckon up Fifteen distinct Parts, which are the Bone, the
  Cartilage, the Ligament, the Tendon, the Membrane, the Fibre, the Nerve,
  the Vein, the Artery, the Flesh, the Fat, the Skin, the Scarf-Skin, the
  Hair, and the Nails.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Bone?</i></p>

  <p>It is the hardest and driest Part of the whole Body, and that which
  constitutes its principal Support.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Cartilage or Gristle?</i></p>

  <p>It is a yielding and supple Part, which partakes of the Nature of a
  Bone, and is always fasten'd to its Extremities, to mollifie and
  facilitate its Motion.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Ligament?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Membranous Contexture usually sticking to the Bones to contain
  them; as also sometimes to other Parts, to suspend, and retain them in
  their proper place.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Tendon?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Tail or Extremity of the Muscles, made by the re-union of
  all the Fibres of their Body, which serves to corroborate it in its
  Action, and to give Motion to the Part.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Membrane?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Nervous Part, the use whereof is to adorn and secure the
  Cavities of the Body on the inside, and to wrap up or cover the
  Parts.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Fibre?</i></p>

  <p>They are fleshy Lines of which the Body of a Muscle is compos'd.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Nerve?</i></p>

  <p>It is a long, white, and thin Body, consisting <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>of many Fibres, enclos'd
  within a double Tunick, and design'd to carry the Animal Spirits into all
  the Parts, to give them Sense and Motion.</p>

  <p><i>What is an Artery?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Canal compos'd of Four Coats, that carreyth with a kind of
  Beating or Pulse even to the very Extremity of the Parts, the Blood full
  of Spirits, which proceeds from the Heart, to distribute to them at the
  same time both Life and Nourishment.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Vein?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Canal made likewise of Four Tunicles, which receives the
  Arterial Blood, to carry it back to the Heart.</p>

  <p><i>What is Flesh?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Part which is form'd of Blood thicken'd by the natural Heat;
  and that constitutes the Body of a Muscle.</p>

  <p><i>What is Fat?</i></p>

  <p>It is a soft Body made of the Unctuous and Sulphurous part of the
  Blood.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Derma<i> or Skin?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Net compos'd of Fibres, Veins, Arteries, Lymphatick Vessels
  and Nerves, which covers the whole Body to defend it from the Injuries of
  the Air, and to serve as a universal Emunctory: It is very thin in the
  Face, sticking close to the Flesh, and is pierc'd with an infinite number
  of imperceptible Pores, affording a Passage to insensible
  Transpiration.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Epiderma<i>, or Scarf-Skin?</i></p>

  <p>It is a small fine Skin, transparent and insensible, having also
  innumerable Pores for the discharging of Sweat, and other Humours by <!--
  Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>imperceptible Transpiration: It is extended
  over the whole inner Skin, to dull its too exquisite Sense, by covering
  the Extremities of the Nerves which are there terminated. It also renders
  the same Skin even and smooth, and so contributes very much to
  Beauty.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Hair?</i></p>

  <p>The Hairs are certain hollow Filaments planted in the Glandules of the
  Skin, from whence their Nourishment is deriv'd. They constitute the
  Ornament of some Parts, cover those which Modesty requires to be
  conceal'd, and defend others from the injury of the Weather.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Nail?</i></p>

  <p>The Nails are a Continuity of the Skin harden'd at the end of the
  Fingers, to strengthen and render them fit for Work.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> IV.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the general Division of a Humane
Body.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How is the Humane Body divided before it is dissected, in order to
  Anatomical Demonstration?</i></p>

  <p>Some Anatomists distinguish it into <i>Similar</i> and
  <i>Dissimilar</i> Parts, appropriating the former Denomination to all the
  simple Parts of the Body taken separately, as a Bone, a Vein, a Nerve,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> but they attribute the Name of Dissimilar to all those
  Members that are compos'd of many Similar or Simple Parts together; such
  are the Arms, <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>Legs, Eyes, <i>&amp;c.</i> wherein are
  contain'd all at once, Bones, Veins, Nerves, and other parts.</p>

  <p>Others divide it into <i>containing</i> and <i>contained</i> Parts,
  the former enclosing the others, as the Skull includes the Brain, and the
  Breast the Lungs; whereas the contained Parts are shut up within others;
  as the Entrails within the Belly, the Brain within the Skull,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Others again divide the whole Body into <i>Spermatick</i> and
  <i>Sanguineous</i> Parts; the former being those which are made at the
  time of Formation; and the latter all those that are grown afterward by
  the Nourishment of the Blood.</p>

  <p><i>Are there not also other Methods of dividing the Humane
  Body?</i></p>

  <p>Yes: Many Persons consider it as a Contexture of Bones, Flesh, Vessels
  and Entrails, which they explain in four several Treatises, whereof the
  first is call'd <i>Osteology</i>, for the Bones; the second
  <i>Myology</i>, for the Muscles; the third <i>Angiology</i>, for the
  Veins, Arteries and Nerves, which are the Vessels; and the fourth
  <i>Splanchnology</i>, for the Entrails.</p>

  <p>But lastly, the most clear and perspicuous of all the Divisions of the
  Body of Man, is that which compares it to a Tree, whereof the Trunk is
  the Body, and the Branches are the Arms and Legs. The Body is divided
  into three <i>Venters</i>, or great Cavities, <i>viz.</i> the Upper, the
  Middle, and the Lower, which are the Head, the Breast, and the lower
  Belly. The Arms are distributed into the Arms properly so called, the
  Elbow and Hands; and the Legs in like manner into Thighs, Shanks, <!--
  Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>and
  Feet: The Hands being also subdivided into the <i>Carpus</i> or Wrist,
  <i>Metacarpium</i> or Back of the Hand, and the Fingers; as the Feet into
  the <i>Tarsus</i>, <i>Metatarsus</i>, and Toes. This vision is at present
  follow'd in the Anatomical Schools.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> V.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Skeleton.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Why is Anatomy usually begun with the Demonstration of the
  Skeleton, or Contexture of Bones?</i></p>

  <p>Because the Bones serve for the Foundation Connexion, and Support of
  all other Parts of the Body.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Skeleton?</i></p>

  <p>It is a gathering together, or Conjunction of all the Bones of the
  Body almost in their Natural Situation.</p>

  <p><i>From whence are the principal differences of the Bones
  derived?</i></p>

  <p>They are taken from their Substance, Figure, Articulation, and
  Use.</p>

  <p><i>How is all this to be understood?</i></p>

  <p>First then, with respect to their Substance, there are some Bones
  harder than others; as those of the Legs compared with those of the
  Back-Bone. Again, in regard of their Figure, some are long, as those of
  the Arm; and others short, as those of the <i>Metacarpium</i>. Some are
  also broad, as those of the Skull and <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span><i>Omoplatæ</i> or
  Shoulder-Blades; and others narrow, as the Ribbs. But with respect to
  their Articulation, some are joined by thick Heads, which are received
  into large Cavities, as the Huckle-Bones with those of the Hips; and
  others are united by the means of a simple Line, as the Chin-Bones.
  Lastly, with relation to their Use; some serve to support and carry the
  whole Body, as the Leg-Bones, and others are appointed to grind the Meat,
  as the Teeth; or else to form some Cavity, as the Skull-Bone, and those
  of the Ribs.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Parts to be distinguished in the Bones?</i></p>

  <p>They are the Body, the Ends, the Heads, the Neck, the
  <i>Apophyses</i>, the <i>Epiphyses</i>, the <i>Condyli</i> or
  Productions, the Cavities, the <i>Supercilia</i> or Lips, and the
  Ridges.</p>

  <p>The Body is the greatest Part, and the middle of the Bone; the Ends
  are the two Extremities; the Heads are the great Protuberances at the
  Extremities; the Neck is that Part which lies immediately under the Head;
  the <i>Apophyses</i> or Processes are certain Bunches or Knobs at the
  Ends of the Bones, which constitute a Part of them; the <i>Epiphyses</i>
  are Bones added to the Extremities of other Bones; the <i>Condyli</i> or
  Productions are the small Elevations or Extuberances of the Bones; the
  Cavities are certain Holes or hollow places; the <i>Supercilia</i> or
  Lips are the Extremities of the Sides of a Cavity, which is at the End of
  a Bone; the Ridges are the prominent and saliant Parts in the length of
  the Body of the Bone. <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span></p>

  <p><i>How are the Bones join'd together?</i></p>

  <p>Two several ways, <i>viz.</i> by <i>Articulation</i> and
  <i>Symphysis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Articulations are there in the Bones?</i></p>

  <p>There are generally two kinds, <i>viz.</i> <i>Diarthrosis</i> and
  <i>Synarthrosis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is Diarthrosis?</i></p>

  <p><i>Diarthrosis</i> is a kind of Articulation which serves for sensible
  Motions.</p>

  <p><i>How many kinds of Diarthroses, or great Motions are there?</i></p>

  <p>There are Three, <i>viz.</i> <i>Enarthrosis</i>, <i>Arthrodia</i>, and
  <i>Ginglymus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Enarthrosis</i> is a kind of Articulation which unites two Bones
  with a great Head on one side, and a large Cavity on the other; as the
  Head of the Thigh-Bone in the Cavity of the <i>Ischion</i> or
  Huckle-Bone.</p>

  <p><i>Arthrodia</i> is a sort of Articulation, by the means whereof two
  Bones are join'd together with a flat Head receiv'd into a Cavity of a
  small depth. Such is the Head of the Shoulder-Bone with the Cavity of the
  <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade; and that of the Twelfth
  <i>Vertebra</i> of the Back with the first of the Loins.</p>

  <p><i>Ginglymus</i> is a kind of Articulation which unites two Bones,
  each whereof hath at their Ends a Head and a Cavity, whereby they both
  receive and are received at the same time, such is the Articulation in
  the Bones of the Elbow and the <i>Vertebræ</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Synarthrosis<i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>Synarthrosis</i> being opposite to <i>Diarthrosis</i>, is a <!--
  Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>close or
  compacted Articulation, destitute of any sensible Motion.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of </i>Synarthroses<i>, or close Articulations are
  there?</i></p>

  <p>There are Three. <i>viz.</i> <i>Sutura</i>, <i>Harmonia</i>, and
  <i>Gomphosis</i>.</p>

  <p>A <i>Suture</i> is that which joins together two Bones by a kind of
  Seam or Stitch, or by a Connexion of their Extremities dispos'd in form
  of a Saw, the Teeth whereof are reciprocally let one into another: Such
  are the Sutures of the Skull-Bones.</p>

  <p><i>Harmonia</i> is the uniting of two Bones by a simple Line; as the
  Bone of the Cheek with that of the Jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Gomphosis</i> is a kind of close Articulation, which unites two
  Bones after the manner of Nails or Wooden Pins fixt in the Holes made to
  receive them: Such is that of the Teeth in their Sockets.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Symphysis<i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>Symphysis</i> is the uniting of two Bones by the interposition of a
  <i>Medium</i>, which ties them very streight together, being also
  threefold: Such is the Connexion of the Knee-Pan or Whirl-Bone of the
  Knee, and the <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade.</p>

  <p><i>Are not these three kinds of Articulations or </i>Symphyses<i>
  distinguish'd one from another?</i></p>

  <p>Yes; for tho' they are all made by the means of a third Body
  intervening, which joins them together; nevertheless every one of these
  various Bodies gives a different Denomination to its respective
  Articulation: Thus the Articulation which is caus'd by a Glutinous and
  <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>Cartilaginous Substance, is properly call'd
  <i>Synchondrosis</i>; as that of the Nose, Chin, <i>Os Pubis</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> But an Articulation which is made by a Ligament is termed
  <i>Synncurosis</i>, as that of the Knee-Pan. Lastly, that which is
  wrought by the means of Flesh, bears the Name of <i>Syssarcosis</i>; as
  the Jaw-Bones, the <i>Os Hyoides</i>, and the <i>Omoplata</i> or
  Shoulder-Blade.</p>

  <p><i>Have the Bones any sense of Feeling or Motion?</i></p>

  <p>They have neither; for their sense of Pain proceeds from nothing else
  but their <i>Periostium</i>, or the Membrane with which they are cover'd,
  and their Motion is perform'd only by the Muscles that draw them.</p>

  <p><i>Doth the Marrow afford any Nutriment to the Bones?</i></p>

  <p>No, all the Bones are nourish'd by the Blood, as the other Parts; but
  the Marrow is to the Bones what the Fat is to the Flesh; that is to say,
  it is a kind of Oil or Unctuous Substance, which moistens, and renders
  them less brittle.</p>

  <p><i>Are all the Bones of the same Colour?</i></p>

  <p>No, they follow the Temperament and Constitution of the Persons.</p>

  <p><i>How many in number are the Bones of the Humane Skeleton?</i></p>

  <p>There are two hundred and fifty usually reckon'd, <i>viz.</i> 61 in
  the Head, 67 in the Trunk or Chest, 62 in the Arms and Hands, and 60 in
  the Legs and Feet; but the true Number cannot be exactly determin'd, by
  reason that some Persons have more, and others fewer; for some have more
  <i>Ossa Sesamoidea</i>, Teeth and <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span>Breast-Bones than others:
  Again, some have many indentings in the <i>Lambdoidal</i> Suture, and
  others have none at all.</p>

  <p><i>Can you rehearse the Number of the Bones of the Head?</i></p>

  <p>There are Fifteen in the Skull, and Forty six in the Face.</p>

  <p>The Fifteen of the Skull are the <i>Coronal</i> for the fore-part of
  the Head; the <i>Occipital</i> for the hinder-part; the two
  <i>Parietals</i> for the upper-part and each side; the two
  <i>Temporals</i> for the Temples; the <i>Os Sphenoides</i> or
  <i>Cuneiforme</i>, which closeth the <i>Basis</i> or bottom of the Skull;
  the <i>Os Ethmoides</i>, or <i>Cribriforme</i>, situated at the Root of
  the Nose; and the four little Bones of the Ear on each side, <i>viz.</i>
  the <i>Incus</i> or Anvil; the <i>Stapes</i> or Stirrup; the
  <i>Malleolus</i> or Hammer; and the <i>Orbiculare</i> or Orbicular
  Bone.</p>

  <p>Of the Forty six of the Face, Twenty seven are counted in the
  Upper-Jaw, <i>viz.</i> the two <i>Zygomatick</i>, or the two Bones of the
  Cheek-Knots; the two <i>Lachrymal</i> in the great Corners of the Eyes
  toward the Nose; the two <i>Maxillar</i>, that receive the Upper-Teeth,
  and which form part of the Palate of the Mouth, and the Orbits of the
  Eyes; the two Bones of the Nose; the two Palate-Bones which are at its
  end, and behind the Nostrils; the last being single is the <i>Vomer</i>,
  which makes the Division of the lower part of the Nostrils; and there are
  generally Sixteen Upper-Teeth. The Lower-Jaw contains Nineteen Bones,
  <i>viz.</i> sixteen Teeth; two Bones that receive them; and the <i>Os
  Hyoides</i>, which is single, and fix'd at the Root of the Tongue. <!--
  Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span></p>

  <p><i>How are the Teeth usually divided with respect to their
  Qualities?</i></p>

  <p>Into <i>Incisive</i> or Cutters, <i>Canine</i> or Dog-Teeth, and
  <i>Molar</i> or Grinders: There are eight Incisive, and four Canine,
  which have only one single Root; as also twenty Molar, every one whereof
  hath one, two, or three Roots.</p>

  <p><i>Can you recite the Number of the Bones of the Trunk or
  Chest?</i></p>

  <p>There are generally thirty and three in the <i>Spine</i> or Chine-Bone
  of the Back, <i>viz.</i> seven <i>Vertebra's</i> in the Neck, twelve in
  the Back, five in the Legs, five, six, and sometimes seven in the <i>Os
  Sacrum</i>, three or four in the <i>Coccyx</i>, and two Cartilages at its
  end.</p>

  <p>There are twenty nine in the Breast, <i>viz.</i> twenty four Ribs, two
  Clavicles or Channel-Bones and commonly three Bones in the
  <i>Sternum</i>. The Hip-Bones are likewise divided into three,
  <i>viz.</i> <i>Ilion</i>, <i>Ischion</i> and <i>Os Pubis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Do you know the Number of the Bones of the Arms?</i></p>

  <p>There are thirty and one Bones in each Arm, that is to say, the
  <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade; the <i>Humerus</i> or Shoulder-Bone;
  the two Bones of the Elbow call'd <i>Ulna</i>, and <i>Radius</i>; eight
  little Bones in the <i>Carpus</i> or Wrist; five in the
  <i>Metacarpium</i> or Back of the Hand; and fourteen in the Fingers,
  three to every one except the Thumb, which hath only two.</p>

  <p><i>Can you give us a List of the Bones of the Leg in their
  Order?</i></p>

  <p>There are thirty Bones in each Leg, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Femur</i> or
  great Thigh-Bone, the Knee-Pan or <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>Whirl-Bone on the top of
  the Knee; the <i>Tibia</i>, <i>greater Focile</i>, or Shin-Bone; and the
  <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i>, or <i>lesser Focile</i>, which are the
  two associated Bones of the Leg; seven little Bones in the <i>Tarsus</i>;
  five in the <i>Metatarsus</i>; and fourteen in the Toes; that is to say,
  three to every one, except the great Toe, which hath only two.</p>

  <p>Thus the Number of Bones of the Humane <i>Skeleton</i> amounts to two
  hundred and Fifty, without reckoning the <i>Sesamoides</i>, the
  Indentings of the Skull, and some others which are not always to be
  found.</p>

<h3><i>Of Myology, or the Anatomy of the
Muscles of a Humane Body.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Muscle?</i></p>

  <p>It is the principal Organ or Instrument of Motion; or it is a Portion
  of Flesh, wherein there are Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and Fibres, and
  which is cover'd with a Membrane.</p>

  <p><i>How many parts are there in a Muscle?</i></p>

  <p>Three, <i>viz.</i> the Head, the Belly, and the Tail: The Head is that
  part thro' which the Nerve enters; the Belly is the Body or Middle of the
  Muscle; and the Tail is the Extremity, where all the Fibres of the Muscle
  are terminated to make the Tendon or String which is fasten'd to the Part
  whereto it gives Motion. <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span></p>

  <p><i>Have all the Muscles their Fibres streight from the Head to the
  Tail?</i></p>

  <p>No, some have them streight, others transverse, and others oblique or
  circular, according to the several Motions to which they are
  appropriated.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Muscles are there with respecting to their
  Action?</i></p>

  <p>There are two different kinds, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Antagonists</i> and
  the <i>Congenerate</i>; the former are those that produce opposite
  Motions; as a <i>Flexor</i> and an <i>Extensor</i>, a <i>Depressor</i>
  and a <i>Levator</i>. The Congenerate are those that contribute to one
  and the same Action; as when there are two Flexors or two Extensors, and
  then one supplies the defect of the other; whereas when one of the
  Antagonist Muscles is cut, the other becomes useless, and void of
  Action.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Action of a Muscle perform'd?</i></p>

  <p>It is done by Contraction and Extension; the former causeth the <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Anatgonist'.">Antagonist</span>
  to swell, and the other compels it to stretch forth in length.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Aponeurosis<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is the continuity of the Fibres of a Tendon which makes a Connexion
  that serves to strengthen the Muscle in its Motion.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> VII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Myology, or Anatomy of the
Muscles of the Head.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there appointed to move the Head, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>The Head is mov'd by the means of fourteen Muscles, seven on each
  side; of these, two serve to depress it, eight to lift it up, and four to
  turn it round about.</p>

  <p>The two Depressors are call'd <i>Sternoclinomastoidei</i>; they take
  their Rise in the <i>Sternum</i>, at the Clavicles, and proceed obliquely
  to join the <i>Apophysis Mastoides</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the four Elevators on each side the first is the <i>Splenius</i>,
  which begins at the five <i>Vertebræ</i> of the Back and the three lower
  ones of the Neck, and ascending obliquely, cleaves to the hinder part of
  the Head. The second, named <i>Complexus</i> or <i>Trigeminus</i>, having
  its beginning as the <i>Splenius</i>, sticks in like manner to the hinder
  part of the Head, and they form together a figure resembling that of S.
  <i>Andrew</i>'s Cross. The third is the <i>Rectus Major</i>, which
  proceeding from the second <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck, shoots forward to
  join the hinder part of the Head. The fourth is the <i>Rectus Minor</i>,
  which begins at the first <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck, and ends likewise
  in the hinder part of the Head.</p>

  <p>The two Muscles on each side, which move the Head circularly, are the
  <i>Obliquus Major</i> and <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span><i>Minor</i>; the <i>greater Oblique</i>
  taking its rise from the second <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck, goes to meet
  the first; but the <i>lesser Oblique</i> hath its Origine in the hinder
  part of the Head, and proceeds to join the other obliquely in the first
  <i>Vertebra</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Lower-Jaw, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>The Lower-Jaw hath twelve Muscles which cause it to move; that is to
  say, six on each side, whereof four serve to close and two to open
  it.</p>

  <p>The first of the Openers is the <i>Latus</i>, which beginning at the
  top of the <i>Sternum</i>, Clavicle, and <i>Acromion</i>, cleaves on the
  outside to the bottom of the Lower-Jaw-Bone. The second of the Openers is
  the <i>Digastricus</i>, which takes its rise in a Fissure lying between
  the Occipital Bone and the <i>Apophysis Mastoides</i>, from whence it
  passeth to the bottom of the Chin on the inside.</p>

  <p>The first of the Shutters is the <i>Crotaphites</i> or Temporal
  Muscle, which hath its Origine at the bottom, and on the side of the
  <i>Os Coronale</i>, the <i>Os Parietale</i>, and the <i>Os Petrosum</i>,
  from whence it is extended till it cleaves to the <i>Apophysis
  Coronoides</i> of the Lower-Jaw, after having passed above the
  <i>Apophysis</i> of the <i>Zygoma</i>: Its Fibres are spread from the
  Circumference to the Center, and it is covered again with the
  <i>Pericranium</i>, which renders its Wounds very dangerous; so that the
  least Incisions as can be, ought to be made therein.</p>

  <p>The second is the <i>Pterygoideus</i> or <i>Aliformis Externus</i>,
  whose rise is in the <i>Apophysis Pterygoides</i>, from whence it sets
  forward till it stick between the <i>Condylus</i> and the Coronal of the
  Lower-Jaw.</p>

  <p>The third is the <i>Masseter</i>, which hath two <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>Sources or Beginnings,
  and as many Insertions; the first Source thereof is at the Cheek-Knot or
  Ball of the Cheek, and the second at the lower part of the <i>Zygoma</i>.
  The first Insertion is at the outer Corner of the Jaw, and the second in
  the middle part, by that means forming the Figure of the Letter X.</p>

  <p>The fourth is the <i>Pterygoideus</i> or <i>Aliformis Internus</i>,
  which hath its beginning in the <i>Apophysis Pterygoides</i>, and is
  terminated in the inner Corner of the Jaw; so that Mastication or Chewing
  is perform'd by the means of these four Muscles.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Face, and which be they?</i></p>

  <p>There are two for the Forehead, call'd <i>Frontal</i>, whose Origine
  is in the upper part of the Head, from whence they descend by streight
  Fibres, until they are fasten'd in the Skin of the Forehead near the
  Eye-Brows, where they are re-united: Their Action or Office is to draw
  the Skin of the Forehead upward, whereto they stick very close.</p>

  <p>There are also two others call'd <i>Occipital</i>, which have their
  Beginning in the same place with the preceeding, but they descend
  backward, and cleave to the Skin of the hinder part of the Head, which
  they draw upward.</p>

  <p>There are two Muscles to each Eye-Lid, one whereof is termed the
  <i>Attollens</i> or <i>Elevator</i> and the other the <i>Depressor</i>.
  The Elevator takes its rise in the bottom of the Orbit of the Eye, and is
  fastned by a large <i>Aponeurosis</i> to the edge of the upper Eye-Lid.
  The Shutter or Depressor, call'd also the <i>Orbicular</i>, hath its
  Origine in the great <i>Canthus</i>, or Corner of the Eye, passeth over
  the <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>Eye-Lid upward, and is join'd to the lesser
  Corner of the same Eye, being extended along its whole Compass.</p>

  <p>The Eyes have each six Muscles, <i>viz.</i> four <i>Recti</i> and two
  <i>Obliqui</i>; the <i>Recti</i> or streight Muscles are the
  <i>Elevator</i>, the <i>Depressor</i>, the <i>Adductor</i>, and the
  <i>Abductor</i>. The first of these call'd <i>Elevator</i>, or
  <i>Superbus</i>, draws the Eye upward, as it is pull'd downward by the
  <i>Depressor</i> or <i>Humilis</i>; the <i>Adductor</i> or
  <i>Bibitorius</i> draws it toward the Nose, and the <i>Abductor</i> or
  <i>Indignarorius</i> toward the Shoulder: All these small Muscles have
  their Originals and Insertions in the bottom of the Orbit through which
  the Optick Nerve passeth, and are terminated in the Corneous Tunicle, by
  a very large <i>Tendon</i>.</p>

  <p>The first of the Oblique ones is term'd the <i>Obliquus Major</i>, and
  the other <i>Obliquus Minor</i>, because they draw the Eye obliquely.
  These Muscles cause Children to squint when they do not act together. The
  <i>Obliquus Minor</i> is fasten'd at the outward part of the Orbit near
  the great Corner, and draws the Eye obliquely toward the Nose: But the
  <i>Obliquus Major</i> is fixt in the inner part of the Orbit, and ascends
  along the Bone to the upper part of the great Corner, where its Tendon
  passeth thro' a small Cartilage nam'd <i>Trochlea</i>, and is inserted in
  the little Corner with the lesser <i>Obliquus Minor</i>, to draw the Eye
  obliquely toward the lesser Corner.</p>

  <p>The Ear, altho' not usually endu'd with any sensible Motion,
  nevertheless hath four Muscles, <i>viz.</i> one above, and three behind;
  the first being situated over the Temporal, and fasten'd to the Ear to
  draw it upward: The three others have <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>their beginning in the
  <i>Mammillary Apophysis</i>, and are terminated in the Root of the Ear,
  to draw it backward.</p>

  <p>There are also three Muscles in the inner part of the Ear, whereof the
  external belonging to the <i>Malleus</i> or Hammer lies under the
  exterior part of the Bony Passage which reacheth from the Ear to the
  Palate of the Mouth, being fixt in a very oblique Sinuosity which is made
  immediately above the Bone that bears the Furrow, into which is let the
  Skin of the <i>Tympanum</i> or Drum. The internal Muscle lies hid in a
  Bony Semi-Canal, in the <i>Os Petrosum</i>; one part of which Semi-Canal
  is without the Drum, and clos'd on the top with a Passage that leads from
  the Ear into the Palate. But the other part within the Drum advanceth to
  the <i>Fenestra Ovalis</i>, and is inserted in the hinder part of the
  Handle of the <i>Malleus</i>. The Muscle of the <i>Stapes</i> or Stirrup
  is also hid in a Bony Tube, almost at the bottom of the Drum, and fixt in
  the Head of the <i>Stapes</i>.</p>

  <p>The Nose hath seven Muscles, that is to say, one common and six
  proper; the common constitutes part of the orbicular Muscle of the Lips,
  and draws the Nose downward with the Lip. Of the six proper Muscles of
  the Nose, four serve to dilate it, being situated on the outside, and two
  to contract it, which are placed in the inside.</p>

  <p>The two first Dilatators of a Pyramidal Figure, take their rise in the
  Suture of the Forehead, and are fasten'd by a large Filament to the
  <i>Alæ</i> of the Nose. The two other Dilatators resembling a Myrtle-Leaf
  have their Source in <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>the Bone of the Nose, and are inserted in
  the middle of the <i>Ala</i>.</p>

  <p>The two Restrictors are Membranous, beginning in the internal part of
  the Bone of the Nose and adhering to the inner <i>Ala</i> of the
  Nostril.</p>

  <p>The Lips have thirteen Muscles, <i>viz.</i> eight proper, and five
  common: Of the proper there are four for the Upper-Lip, and as many for
  the Lower: with two common for each, and the odd one.</p>

  <p>The first of the proper of the Upper-Lip bears the Name of the
  <i>Incisivus</i>, its Origine being in the Jaw, in the place of the
  Incisive Teeth and its Insertion is in the Upper-Lip.</p>

  <p>The second is the <i>Triangulis</i>, Antagonist to the former; its
  Rise is on the outside, at the bottom of the Lower-Jaw; and it is
  implanted in the Upper-Lip, near the Corner of the Mouth.</p>

  <p>The third being the <i>Quadratus</i>, springs from the bottom of the
  Chin before, and cleaves to the edge of the Lower-Lip.</p>

  <p>The fourth is the <i>Caninus</i>, Antagonist to the <i>Quadratus</i>,
  beginning in the Upper-Jaw-Bone and being terminated in the Lower-Lip
  near the Corner of the Mouth.</p>

  <p>The first of the common is the <i>Zygomaticus</i>, the Origine whereof
  is in the <i>Zygoma</i> and its Insertion in the Corner of the Mouth, to
  draw it toward the Ears; so that it is the Muscle which acts when we
  laugh.</p>

  <p>The second of the common is the <i>Buccinator</i> or Trumpeter, which
  is swell'd when one sounds a Trumpet. It hath its rise at the Root of the
  Molar Teeth of both the Jaws, and is extended quite round about the Lips.
  <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span></p>

  <p>The odd Muscle, or the thirteenth in number, is the <i>Orbicular</i>,
  which makes a <i>Sphincter</i> round about the Lips to close or shut them
  up.</p>

  <p>The <i>Uvula</i> or Palate of the Mouth hath four Muscles, whereof the
  two first are the <i>Peristaphylini Externi</i>, taking their rise from
  the Upper-Jaw, above the Left Molar Tooth, and being ty'd to the Palate
  by a thin <i>Tendon</i>.</p>

  <p>The two others are the <i>Peristaphylini Interni</i>, which have their
  beginning in the <i>Apophysis Pterygoides</i> on the inside, and likewise
  stick to the Palate.</p>

  <p>The Tongue, altho' all over Musculous and Fibrous, yet doth not cease
  to have its peculiar Muscles, which are eight in Number.</p>

  <p>The first of these is call'd <i>Genioglossus</i>, taking its rise in
  the lower part of the Chin, from whence it is extended till it cleave to
  the Root of the Tongue before, to cause it to go out of the Mouth.</p>

  <p>The second is term'd <i>Styloglossus</i>, its Rise being in the
  <i>Apophysis Styloides</i>, from whence it passeth to the side above the
  Tongue, to lift it up.</p>

  <p>The third bearing the Name of <i>Basiglossus</i>, commenceth in the
  <i>Basis</i> or Root of the <i>Os Hyoides</i>, and thence insinuates it
  self into the Root of the Tongue, to draw it back to the bottom of the
  Mouth.</p>

  <p>The fourth is the <i>Ceratoglossus</i>, deriving its Original from the
  Horn of the <i>Os Hyoides</i>, and cleaving to the side of the Tongue to
  draw it on one side: The Action of these Muscles of both sides together,
  causeth an Orbicular Motion in the Tongue. To these some add a fifth <!--
  Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>Pair of
  Muscles, call'd <i>Myloglossus</i>, which serves to draw it obliquely
  upward.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Action of the </i>Os Hyoides<i> in the Throat, and how
  many Muscles hath it?</i></p>

  <p>The use of the <i>Os Hyoides</i> is to consolidate the Root of the
  Tongue; and it hath five Muscles on each side, which keep it as it were
  hung up.</p>

  <p>The first of these, call'd the <i>Geniohyoideus</i> hath its beginning
  in the Chin on the inside, and adheres to the top of the <i>Os
  Hyoides</i>, which it draws upward.</p>

  <p>The second is the <i>Mylohyoideus</i>, whose Origine is in the inner
  side of the Jaw, from whence it cleaves side-ways to the Root of the
  <i>Os Hyoides</i>, which it draws upward, and to one side.</p>

  <p>The third is the <i>Stylohyoideus</i>, which after it hath taken its
  rise in the <i>Apophysis Styloides</i>, is fasten'd to the Horn of the
  <i>Os Hyoides</i>, to draw it toward the side.</p>

  <p>The fourth is the <i>Coracohyoideus</i>, which springing up from the
  <i>Apophysis Coracoides</i> of the <i>Omoplata</i>, cleaves to the Root
  and side of the <i>Os Hyoides</i>, to draw it downward and to the
  side.</p>

  <p>The fifth is the <i>Sternomohyoideus</i>, that hath its beginning in
  the Bone of the <i>Sternum</i> on the inside and is inserted in the Root
  of the <i>Os Hyoides</i>, which it draws downward.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles hath the </i>Larynx<i>?</i></p>

  <p>There are fourteen, <i>viz.</i> four Common, and ten Proper. The first
  Pair of the Common is the <i>Sternothyroideus</i> or <i>Bronchycus</i>,
  which proceeding from the inside, and the top of the <i>Sternum</i>,
  ascends along the Cartilages of the Wind-Pipe, and is terminated in the
  bottom of the <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span><i>Scutiformis</i> or Buckler-like
  Cartilage, which it draws downward. The second is the
  <i>Hyothyroideus</i>, which ariseth from the Root of the <i>Os
  Hyoides</i>, and is inserted in that of the <i>Scutiforme</i>. This
  Muscle serves to lift up the <i>Larynx</i>, as also to dilate the bottom
  of the <i>Scutiformis</i>, and to close its top.</p>

  <p>The first Pair of the Proper is the <i>Cricothyroideus Anticus</i>,
  which deriving its Original from the hinder and upper part of the
  <i>Cricoides</i>, or Ring-like Cartilage, is fixt in the upper and
  lateral part of the <i>Scutiformis</i>, to close or shut it up.</p>

  <p>The second is the <i>Thyroides</i>.</p>

  <p>The third is the <i>Cricoarytenoideus Lateralis</i>, which proceeds
  from the side of the <i>Cricoides</i> within, and is fasten'd to the
  bottom and side of the <i>Arytenoides</i>, which it removes to dilate the
  Mouth of the <i>Larynx</i>.</p>

  <p>The fourth is the <i>Thyroarytenoideus</i>, which <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'ari-rising' on line break."
  >arising</span> from the fore-part on the inside of the
  <i>Scutiformis</i>, is terminated on the side of the <i>Arytenoides</i>,
  to close the Orifice of the <i>Larynx</i>.</p>

  <p>The fifth is the <i>Arytenoideus</i>, which having its Source in that
  place where the <i>Cricoides</i> is united to the <i>Arytenoides</i> is
  inserted in its upper and lateral part, to close the <i>Larynx</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles hath the </i>Pharynx<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It hath seven, the first whereof is the <i>Oesophagieus</i>, which
  takes its rise from the side of the <i>Scutiformis</i> or Buckler-like
  Cartilage, and passing behind the <i>Oesophagus</i> or Gullet, is
  fasten'd to the other side of the Cartilage. It thrusts the Meat down by
  locking up the <i>Pharynx</i> as a <i>Sphincter</i>.</p>

  <p>The second named <i>Stylopharingæus</i>, springs from within the Acute
  <i>Apophysis</i> of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, or <i>Cuneiforme</i>, and
  is inserted obliquely <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>in the side of the <i>Pharynx</i>, which it
  dilates by drawing it upward.</p>

  <p>The third, call'd <i>Sphenopharyngæus</i>, proceeds from the
  <i>Apophysis Styliformis</i>, and is terminated in the side of the
  <i>Pharynx</i>, which it dilates by drawing its sides.</p>

  <p>The fourth Pair is the <i>Cephalopharyngæus</i> which ariseth from the
  articulation of the Head with the first <i>Vertebra</i>, and closeth the
  <i>Larynx</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Neck, and which be they?</i></p>

  <p>There are four Muscles in the Neck on each side, <i>viz.</i> two
  Flexors, and two Extensors. The <i>Flexors</i> are the <i>Scalenus</i>
  and the <i>Rectus</i> or <i>Longus</i>; and the Extenders are the
  <i>Spinatus</i> and the <i>Transversalis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Scalenu'."
  >Scalenus</span></i> or <i>Triangularis</i> hath two remote Sources,
  <i>viz.</i> one in the first Rib, and the other in the Clavicle, and is
  fasten'd to the third and fourth <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rectus</i> or <i>Longus</i> begins in the side of the four
  upper <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back, and is join'd to the upper
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Neck, and the hinder part of the Head.</p>

  <p>The <i>Spinatus</i> hath its Origine in the fourth and fifth upper
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back, and is fasten'd to all the six lower
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Neck.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Myology or Anatomy of the
Muscles of the Chest; or of the Breast
Belly, and Back.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Breast, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>The Breast hath fifty seven Muscles, that is to say, thirty that serve
  to dilate it, twenty six whose Office is to contract it, and the
  <i>Diaphragm</i> or Midriff, which partakes of both Actions.</p>

  <p>The thirty which dilate the Breast are equally plac'd to the number of
  Fifteen, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Subclavius</i>, the <i>Serratus Major
  Anticus</i>, the two <i>Serrati Postici</i>, and the eleven external
  <i>Intercostals</i>.</p>

  <p>The twenty six which contract the Breast are likewise equally rank'd
  to the Number of thirteen on each side, <i>viz.</i> the
  <i>Triangularis</i>, the <i>Sacrolumbus</i>, and eleven internal
  <i>Intercostals</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Subclavian</i> takes up the whole space between the Clavicle
  and the first Rib: Its Original being in the internal and lower part of
  the <i>Clavicula</i>, and its insertion in the upper part of the first
  Rib.</p>

  <p>The <i>Serratus Major</i> is a large Muscle having seven or eight
  Indentings or Jaggs. It takes its rise in the interior Basis of the
  <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade, and its Jaggings are inserted in <!--
  Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>the five
  lower true Ribs, as also in the two upper spurious Ribs.</p>

  <p>The <i>Serratus Posticus Superior</i>, begins with a large
  <i>Aponeurosis</i> in the <i>Apophyses</i> of the three lower
  <i>Vertebræ</i> of the Neck, and of the first of those of the Back; then
  passing under the <i>Rhomboid</i>, it is join'd obliquely by four
  Indentings to the four upper Ribs.</p>

  <p>The <i>Serratus Posticus Inferior</i>, commences in like manner with a
  large <i>Aponeurosis</i> in the <i>Apophyses</i> of the three lower
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back, and of the first of those of the Loins,
  and is afterwards fasten'd by four Digitations to the four lower
  Ribs.</p>

  <p>The eleven <i>External Intercostal</i> Muscles are situated in the
  spaces between the twelve Ribs passing obliquely and on the outside from
  the back part to the fore part. They take their rise below the Upper Rib,
  and have their Insertion above the lower Rib.</p>

  <p>The <i>Triangularis</i> is the first of those that contract the
  Breast, and possesseth the inward part of the <i>Sternum</i>: Its
  Original is in its lower part, and its Insertion in the top of the
  Cartilages of the two upper Ribs.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sacrolumbus</i> hath its Source in the hinder part of the <i>Os
  Sacrum</i>, as also in the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, and ascending
  from thence, insinuates it self into the hinder part of the Ribs, to
  every one of which it imparts two <i>Tendons</i>, one whereof sticks on
  the outside, and the other on the inside. This Muscle is fleshy within,
  and fibrous without.</p>

  <p>The Eleven <i>Internal Intercostals</i>, contrary to the External,
  derive their Original from the <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>top of every lower Rib, and ascend obliquely
  from the back-part to the fore-part, till they are join'd to the lower
  Lip of every upper Rib: Thus these Internal Muscles, with the External,
  form, by the opposition of their Fibres, a Figure resembling a
  <i>Burgundian</i> Cross.</p>

  <p>The Diaphragm or Midriff is esteem'd as the fifty seventh Muscle of
  the Breast, and serves as well for its dilatation as contraction. It
  separates the <i>Thorax</i> or Chest from the lower Belly, and is tied
  circularly to all the Extremities of the Bastard Ribs, immediately under
  the <i>Xiphoides</i>, or Sword-like Cartilage.</p>

  <p>Modern Anatomists have discover'd that the Diaphragm is compos'd of
  two Muscles, <i>viz.</i> one Upper, and the other Lower; so that the
  Upper cleaves to the Extremities of the Spurious Ribs, and is terminated
  in a flat <i>Tendon</i> in the middle, which hath been always taken for
  its Nervous part. The Lower begins with two Productions, the longest
  whereof being on the right side, ariseth from the three upper
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, and the other on the Left from the two
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back, till it is lost in the <i>Aponeurosis</i>
  of the Upper Muscle.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Back and the Loins, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>There are three in each side, <i>viz.</i> one for Flection, and the
  other for Extension.</p>

  <p>The <i>Triangularis</i> is the <i>Flexor</i>, taking its rise in the
  hinder part of the Rib of the <i>Os Ilion</i>, and the inner part of the
  <i>Os Sacrum</i>, in passing from whence it is joined to the last of the
  <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>Bastard Ribs, and to the transverse
  Productions of the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins.</p>

  <p>The <i>Extensors</i> are the <i>Sacer</i>, and the
  <i>Semi-spinatus</i>, which make the Waste streight, and are so
  interwoven along the Back-Bone, that one would imagine that there were as
  many Pairs of Muscles as <i>Vertebra's</i>, affording <i>Tendons</i> to
  all.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sacer</i> springs from behind the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, as also
  from the hinder and upper Extremity of the <i>Os Ilium</i>, and is
  inserted in the Spines of the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins and
  Back.</p>

  <p>The <i>Semi-spinatus</i> hath its Source in the Spines of the <i>Os
  Sacrum</i>, and is join'd to all the transverse Productions of the
  <i>Vertebra's</i> from the Back to the Neck, being exactly situated
  between the <i>Sacer</i> and the <i>Sacrolumbus</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Myology, or Anatomy of the
Muscles of the lower Belly.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the lower Belly, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>There are generally ten, five on each side, that is to say, two
  <i>Obliqui</i>, one ascending, and the other descending; one
  <i>Transversus</i>, one <i>Rectus</i>, and two Pyramidal, of which last,
  nevertheless, there is sometimes only one, and sometimes none at all.
  <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Obliquus Descendens</i>, which is the first, hath its Original
  by digitation in the sixth and seventh of the true Ribs, in all the
  spurious Ribs, and in the transverse <i>Apophyses</i> of the
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, and comes near to the <i>Serratus Major
  Anticus</i> of the Breast; from whence it proceeds to the external Rib of
  the <i>Os Ilion</i>, and is terminated by a large <i>Aponeurosis</i> in
  the <i>Linea Alba</i> or <i>White Line</i>, which separates the Muscles
  that are on each side of the <i>Abdomen</i> or lower Belly.</p>

  <p>The <i>Obliquus Ascendens</i> ariseth from its Source in the upper
  part of the <i>Os Pubis</i>, and in the Ridge of the Hip-Bone, till it
  cleaves to the <i>Apophyses</i> of the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins in
  the Extremities of all the Ribs, and in the <i>Xiphoides</i> or
  Sword-like Cartilage, and is terminated in the White Line by a large
  <i>Aponeurosis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rectus</i> being situated between the <i>Aponeuroses</i> of the
  <i>Obliquus</i>, takes its rise in the Cartilages of the Ribs, in the
  <i>Xiphoides</i> and the <i>Sternum</i>, and enters into the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, having many nervous parts to corroborate it in its length.</p>

  <p>The <i>Transversus</i> having its beginning in the transverse
  <i>Apophyses</i> of the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, is fasten'd to
  the internal Rib of the <i>Os Ilium</i>, and within the Cartilages of the
  lower Ribs, and is terminated by a large <i>Aponeurosis</i> in the
  <i>Linea Alba</i>, passing over the <i>Rectus</i>, and sticking to the
  <i>Peritonæum</i>.</p>

  <p>The Oblique Muscles, and the Transverse, have Holes toward the Groin,
  to give Passage to the Spermatick Vessels of Men, and to a round <!--
  Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span><span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'ment', 'liga-' only as catch-word."
  >ligament</span> of the <i>Matrix</i> in Women; so that Ruptures or
  Burstenness happen through these parts in both Sexes, although the Holes
  of these three Muscles are not situated one over-against another.</p>

  <p>The Pyramidal, so named by reason of its Figure, is situated in the
  lower <i>Tendon</i> of the <i>Rectus</i>, its Origine being in the upper
  and external part of the <i>Os Pubis</i>; but it is terminated in the
  White Line, three Fingers breadth above the <i>Pubes</i>, and sometimes
  even in the Navel itself. These Muscles are not found in all Bodies for
  there are sometimes two, sometimes only one, and sometimes none.</p>

  <p>The use of the Muscles of the lower Belly is to compress all the
  contain'd parts, in order to assist them in expelling the Excrements.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the Testicles?</i></p>

  <p>They have each of them one, call'd <i>Cremaster</i>; this Muscle takes
  its rise from the Ligaments of the <i>Os Pubis</i>, and by the dilatation
  of its Tendon covers the Testicle, which it draws upward.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles hath the </i>Penis<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It hath two Pair, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Erectores</i> or
  <i>Directores</i>, and the <i>Dilatantes</i>: The <i>Erectores</i> arise
  from the internal part of the <i>Os Ischion</i>, under the beginning of
  the <i>Corpora Cavernosa</i>, where they are inserted, and retake their
  Fibres in their Membranes. The <i>Dilatantes</i> or <i>Acceleratores</i>
  have their Source in the <i>Sphincter</i> of the <i>Anus</i> and slipping
  from thence obliquely under the <i>Ureter</i>, are join'd to the Membrane
  of the Nervous Bodies.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the </i>Clitoris<i>?</i> <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span></p>

  <p>It hath two Erectors which spring forth from the Protuberance of the
  <i>Os Ischion</i>, and are inserted in the Nervous Bodies of the
  <i>Clitoris</i>. There are also two others suppos'd to be its Elevators,
  which proceed from the <i>Sphincter</i> of the <i>Anus</i>, and are
  terminated in the <i>Clitoris</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles are there in the </i>Anus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>There are three, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Sphincter</i>, and two
  <i>Levatores</i>. The <i>Sphincter</i> is two Fingers broad, to open and
  close the <i>Rectum</i>. This Muscle being double, is fasten'd in the
  fore-part to the <i>Penis</i> in Men, and to the Neck of the
  <i>Matrix</i> in Women, as also behind to the <i>Coccyx</i>, and
  laterally to the Ligaments of the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, and the Hips.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Levatores</i> arise from the inner and lateral part of the
  <i>Os Ischion</i>, and are fasten'd to the <i>Sphincter</i> of the
  <i>Anus</i>, to lift it up after the expulsion of the Excrements.</p>

  <p>The <i>Bladder</i> hath also a <i>Sphincter</i> Muscle to open and
  shut its Orifice.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Muscles of the </i>Omoplatæ<i>, or
Shoulder-Blades, Arms, and Hands.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How many ways doth the </i>Omoplata<i> or Shoulder-Blade move, and
  what are its Muscles?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Omoplata</i> moves upward, downward, forward, and backward, by
  the means of four proper Muscles, which are the <i>Trapezius</i>, the
  <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span><i>Rhomboides</i>, the proper
  <i>Levator</i>, and the lesser <i>Pectoral</i>, or <i>Serratus Minor
  Anticus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Trapezius</i> or <i>Cucullaris</i> hath its beginning in the
  back part of the <i>Occiput</i>, or hinder part of the Head, in the
  Spines of the six lower <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Neck, and of the nine
  upper of the Back, in passing from whence it is implanted in the Spine of
  the <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade, and the external part of the
  <i>Clavicula</i>, as far as the <i>Acromion</i>. This Muscle produceth
  many Motions by reason of its different Fibres, drawing the
  Shoulder-Blade obliquely upward, downward, and forward.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rhomboides</i> is situated over the <i>Trapezius</i>, its rise
  being in the <i>Apophyses</i> of the three lower <i>Vertebra's</i> of the
  Neck, and of the three upper of the Back, but it is afterward join'd to
  the whole <i>Basis</i> or Root of the <i>Omoplata</i>, which it draws
  backward.</p>

  <p>The proper <i>Levator</i> commenceth in the <i>Transverse
  Apophyses</i> of the four first <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Neck, by
  different Progressions, but is afterward re-united, and inserted in the
  upper Corner of the <i>Omoplata</i>, which it draws upward.</p>

  <p>The <i>lesser Pectoral</i>, or <i>Serratus Minor Anticus</i>, is
  situated under the great <i>Pectoral</i>, its rise being by Digitation or
  Indenting in the second, third, and fourth of the upper Ribs, and its
  Insertion in the <i>Apophysis Coracoides</i> of the Shoulder-Blade, which
  it draws forward.</p>

  <p><i>How many Motions are there in the </i>Humerus<i>, or Arm; which be
  they, and what are its Muscles?</i> <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span></p>

  <p>The Arm performs all sorts of Motions by the help of nine Muscles: For
  it is lifted up by the <i>Deltoides</i> and the <i>Infra-Spinatus</i>; it
  is depress'd by the <i>Largissimus</i>, and the <i>Rotundus Major</i>; it
  is drawn forward by the <i>Pectoralis Major</i>, and the
  <i>Coracoideus</i>; it is drawn backward by the <i>Infra-Spinatus</i>,
  and the <i>Rotundus Minor</i>. It is drawn near the Ribs by the
  <i>Subscapularis</i>, and its circular Motion is performed when all these
  Muscles act together successively.</p>

  <p>The <i>Deltoides</i> or <i>Triangular</i> hath its beginning in the
  whole Spine of the <i>Omoplata</i>, the <i>Acromion</i>, and half the
  <i>Clavicula</i>, and by its point cleaves with a strong <i>Tendon</i> to
  the middle of the Arm.</p>

  <p>The <i>Infra-Spinatus</i> takes its rise in the Cavity that lies above
  the Spine of the <i>Omoplata</i>, which it fills, passing over the
  <i>Acromion</i>, until it is join'd to the Neck of the Shoulder-Bone,
  which it surrounds with a large <i>Tendon</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Largissimus</i>, otherwise call'd <i>Ani-scalptor</i>, covers
  almost the whole Back, proceeding from a large and Nervous Stock, in the
  third and fourth lower <i>Vertebra</i> of the Back, the five
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, the Spine of the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, the
  hinder part of the Lip of the Hip-Bone, and the external part of the
  lower Bastard-Ribs, in passing from whence it insinuates it self into the
  lower Corner of the <i>Omoplata</i>, as also into the upper and inner
  part of the <i>Humerus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rotundus Major</i>, or <i>Teres Major</i>, having its Origin in
  the external Cavity of the lower Corner of the <i>Omoplata</i>, is
  confounded with the <i>Largissimus</i>, and adheres with it by the same
  <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span><i>Tendon</i> to the upper and inner part of
  the <i>Humerus</i>, a little below the Head.</p>

  <p>The greater <i>Pectoral</i> hath its Source in half the
  <i>Clavicula</i>, on the side of the <i>Sternum</i>; covers the fore-part
  of the Breast, and is fasten'd by a short, broad, and nervous
  <i>Tendon</i>, to the top of the Shoulder-Bone, on the inside, between
  the <i>Biceps</i> and the <i>Deltoides</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Coracoideus</i> or <i>Coracobrachyæus</i>, beginning in the
  <i>Apophysis Coracoides</i> of the <i>Omoplata</i> or Shoulder-Blade,
  adheres to the middle of the Arm on the inside, which with the
  <i>Pectoral</i> it draws forward.</p>

  <p>The <i>Infra-Spinatus</i> fills the Cavity which lies below the Spine
  of the <i>Omoplata</i>, its Origine being in the lower Rib of the
  <i>Omoplata</i>, from whence it passeth between the Spine and the
  <i>Rotundus Minor</i>, to cleave to the Neck of the Shoulder-Bone, which
  it embraceth, and draws backward.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rotundus Minor</i>, or <i>Teres Minor</i>, proceeds from the
  lower Rib of the <i>Omoplata</i>, and adheres to the Neck of the
  Shoulder-Bone with the <i>Infra-Spinatus</i> to draw it in like manner
  backward.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sub-scapularis</i> or <i>Immersus</i> is situated entirely
  under the <i>Omaplata</i>, proceeding from the internal Lip of the
  <i>Basis</i> or Root of the same <i>Omoplata</i>, and being terminated in
  the Neck of the Arm-Bone, which it causeth to lie close to the Ribs.</p>

  <p><i>How many Motions are there in the</i> Cubitus <i>or Elbow, and what
  are its Muscles?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Cubitus</i> or <i>Ulna</i> is endu'd with two sorts of Motions,
  <i>viz.</i> that of Flection and that of <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>Extension, the former
  being perform'd by the help of two Muscles, that is to say, the
  <i>Biceps</i>, and the <i>Brachiæus Internus</i>; and the later by eight
  others, which are the <i>Longus</i>, the <i>Brevis</i>, the <i>Brachiæus
  Externus</i>, and the <i>Anconeus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Biceps</i> is a Muscle with two Heads, one whereof proceeds
  from the <i>Apophysis Coracoides</i>, and the other from the
  Cartilaginous edge of the <i>Glenoid</i> Cavity of the <i>Omoplata</i> or
  Shoulder-Blade: These two Heads descend along the fore-part of the Arm,
  and are united in one and the same Body, from whence springs forth a
  Ligament, which is inserted in a tuberosity situated in the upper and
  fore-part of the <i>Radius</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Brachiæus Internus</i> is a small fleshy Muscle, lying hid
  under the <i>Biceps</i>, which takes its rise in the upper and fore-part
  of the <i>Humerus</i>, and is implanted in the upper and inner-part of
  the <i>Radius</i>, to bend the Elbow with the <i>Biceps</i>.</p>

  <p>The first of the four Extenders is the <i>Longus</i> having two
  Sources, <i>viz.</i> one situated in the lower Rib of the
  <i>Omoplata</i>, near its Neck, and the other descending to the
  hinder-part of the Arm, till it is tyed to the <i>Olecranum</i> or
  <i>Ancon</i>, by a strong <i>Aponeurosis</i>, which is common thereto,
  with the <i>Brevis</i>, and the <i>Brachiæus Externus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Brevis</i> or short Muscle of the Elbow arising from the hinder
  and upper-part of the <i>Humerus</i>, is fasten'd to the <i>Olecranum</i>
  with the <i>Longus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Brachiæus Externus</i> is a fleshy Muscle which proceeds from
  the hinder part of the <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span><i>Humerus</i>, and adheres to the
  <i>Olecranum</i> with the <i>Brevis</i> and the <i>Longus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Anconeus</i> or <i>Cubitalis</i> being situated behind the Fold
  of the <i>Cubitus</i>, is the least Muscle of all; it springs from the
  Extremity of the Arm-Bone, at the end of the <i>Brevis</i> and the
  <i>Longus</i>, and in descending is inserted between the <i>Radius</i>
  and the <i>Cubitus</i> or <i>Ulna</i>, three or four Fingers breadth
  below the <i>Olecranum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Muscles hath the </i>Radius<i>, and which are its
  Motions?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Radius</i> is endu'd with a twofold Motion by the means of four
  Muscles: Of these the <i>Rotundus</i> and <i>Quadratus</i> cause that of
  <i>Pronation</i>, as the <i>Longus</i> and the <i>Brevis</i> that of
  <i>Supination</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Pronator Superior Rotundus</i>, or round Muscle of the
  <i>Radius</i>, commenceth from the inner <i>Apophysis</i> of the
  Shoulder-Bone, in a very fleshy Stock, and is terminated obliquely by a
  Membranous <i>Tendon</i> in the middle and exterior part of the
  <i>Radius</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Pronator Inferior Quadratus</i>, springing forth from the
  bottom and inside of the <i>Cubitus</i>, is fixt in the lower and outward
  part of the <i>Radius</i> by a Tail as large as its Head. This Muscle
  lying hid under the others near the Wrist, is that which jointly with the
  <i>Rotundus</i>, turns the Arm with the Palm of the Hand downward, which
  is the Motion of <i>Pronation</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Longus</i> is the first of the <i>Supinators</i>, whose Origine
  is three or four Fingers breadth above the external <i>Apophysis</i> of
  the Arm-Bone; from whence it passeth along the <i>Radius</i>, and cleaves
  to the inner-part of its lower <i>Apophysis</i>. <!-- Page 43 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Brevis</i>, or the second of the <i>Spinators</i> arising from
  the lower part of the <i>Inferior Condylus</i>, and the external of the
  <i>Humerus</i>, is twisted round about the <i>Radius</i>, going forward
  from the hinder-part till it is united to its upper and forepart. This
  Muscle, with the <i>Longus</i>, serves to turn the Arm and the Palm of
  the Hand upward, and produceth the Motion of <i>Supination</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Motions belong to the Wrist, and what are its
  Muscles</i>?</p>

  <p>Two several Motions are perform'd by the Wrist, <i>viz.</i> one of
  Flection, and the other of Extension, three Muscles being appropriated to
  the former, and as many to the later: But it ought to be observed, that a
  strong Ligament, call'd the <i>Annular</i>, appears here, which,
  surrounding all the <i>Tendons</i> of the Muscles as it were a Bracelet,
  holds them together, and elsewhere serves to unite the two Bones of the
  Elbow. The three Flexors or Bending Muscles of the Wrist are the
  <i>Cubitæus Internus</i>, the <i>Radiæus Internus</i>, and the
  <i>Palmaris</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cubitæus Internus</i> derives its Original from the part of the
  Arm-Bone, passeth under the Annular Ligament, and is ty'd by a thick
  <i>Tendon</i> to the small Bone of the Wrist, which is plac'd above the
  others.</p>

  <p>The <i>Radiæus Internus</i> proceeds from the same place with the
  <i>Cubitæus</i>, and is fasten'd to the first Wrist-Bone which supports
  the Thumb. It lies along the <i>Radius</i>, and passeth under the
  <i>Annular</i> Ligament.</p>

  <p>The <i>Palmaris</i> is reckon'd among the Flexors of the Wrist,
  although situated in the Palm of the Hand. It ariseth from the inner
  Process or Knob <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>of the Arm-Bone, and is united by a large
  <i>Tendon</i> to the first <i>Phalanges</i> of the Fingers, slipping
  under the Transverse or <i>Annular</i> Ligament and sticking under the
  Skin of the Palm of the Hand.</p>

  <p>The three extending Muscles of the Wrist are the <i>Cubitæus
  Externus</i>, and the <i>Radiæus Externus</i> or the <i>Longus</i>, and
  the <i>Brevis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cubitæus Externus</i> taking its rise from the hinder-part of
  the Elbow, passeth under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and adheres to the
  upper and outward-part of the Bone of the <i>Metacarpus</i> that stayeth
  the little Finger.</p>

  <p>The <i>Radiæus Externus</i>, or the <i>Longus</i>, having its Origine
  in the edge of the lower part of the Arm-Bone, slides from thence along
  the <i>Radius</i> on the outside, extends it self under the
  <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and cleaves to the Wrist-Bone, which stayeth the
  Fore-Finger.</p>

  <p>The <i>Brevis</i> or <i>short</i> Muscle of the Wrist springs from the
  lower part of the same Edge; afterwards it runs along the <i>Radius</i>,
  passeth under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and is terminated in the Bone
  of the <i>Carpus</i> or Wrist, which stayeth the Middle Finger. But we
  must take notice, that besides these six Muscles, there is also <i>Caro
  quædam quadrata</i>, or a square piece of Flesh under the
  <i>Palmaris</i>, which seems to arise from the <i>Thenar</i>, and sticks
  to the eighth Wrist-Bone. It is supposed that this Musculous piece of
  Flesh serves with the <i>Hypothenar</i> of the little Finger, to make
  that which is call'd <i>Diogenes's Cup</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many Motions are there in the Fingers, and what are their
  Muscles</i>? <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>The Fingers are bent, extended, and turn'd from one side to the other
  by the means of twenty-three Muscles, whereof ten are proper, and
  thirteen common: The former are those that serve all the Fingers in
  general, and the other those that are particularly serviceable to some of
  them: The Common are the <i>Sublimis</i>, the <i>Profundus</i>, the
  common <i>Extensor</i>, the four <i>Lumbricales</i>, and the six
  <i>Interossei</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sublimis</i> or <i>Perforatus</i>, arising from the internal
  part of the lower Process of the <i>Humerus</i> or Shoulder-Bone is
  divided into four <i>Tendons</i>, which run below the <i>Annular</i>
  Ligament of the Wrist, and are inserted in the second <i>Phalanx</i> of
  the Bones of the four Fingers, after having stuck in passing to those of
  the first <i>Phalanx</i>, to help to bend it. It is also observed that
  every one of these <i>Tendons</i> hath a small cleft in its length, to
  let in the <i>Tendons</i> of the <i>Profundus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Profundus</i> or <i>Perforans</i> lies under the
  <i>Sublimis</i>, deriving its Original from the top of the <i>Cubitus</i>
  and <i>Radius</i>. It creeps along these two Bones, and is divided into
  four <i>Tendons</i>, which pass under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and
  slip into the Fissures of the <i>Tendons</i> of the <i>Sublimis</i>, to
  adhere to the third <i>Phalanx</i> of the Fingers, which they bend with
  the <i>Sublimis</i>: So that these two Muscles make together the bending
  of the Fingers.</p>

  <p>The <i>Extensor Magnus</i> is that which extends the four Fingers. It
  springs from the external and lower Process of the Arm-Bone, and is
  divided into four flat <i>Tendons</i>, which pass under the
  <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and cleave <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>to the second and third
  <i>Phalanx</i> of the Fingers.</p>

  <p>The four <i>Lumbricales</i> or <i>Vermiculares</i> are in the Palm of
  the Hand, to draw the Fingers to the Thumb: They proceed from the
  <i>Tendons</i> of the <i>Profundus</i>, and the <i>Annular</i> Ligament,
  extend themselves along the sides of the Fingers and are inserted in
  their second Articulation, to cause the drawing toward the Thumb.</p>

  <p>The three <i>Interossei Interni</i>, and the three <i>Externi</i>, are
  situated between the four Bones of the <i>Metacarpium</i>, as well on the
  inside of the Hand as without: They have their beginning in the Intervals
  or Spaces between the Bones of the <i>Metacarpium</i>, are united with
  the <i>Lumbrical</i>, and fixt in the last Articulation of the Bones of
  the Fingers, to produce the Motion of drawing back or removing from the
  Thumb.</p>

  <p>The Thumb is mov'd by five particular Muscles; one whereof serves to
  bend it, two to extend it, one to remove it from the Fingers, and another
  to draw it to them.</p>

  <p>The <i>Flexor</i> of the Thumb takes its rise from the upper and inner
  part of the <i>Radius</i>, passes under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament, as
  also under the <i>Thenar</i>, and adheres to the first and second Bones
  of the same Thumb to bend it.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Extensors</i> of the Thumb are the <i>Longior</i> and the
  <i>Brevior</i>: The former proceeding from the upper and outward part of
  the <i>Cubitus</i>, ascends above the <i>Radius</i>, and is ty'd with a
  forked <i>Tendon</i> to the second Bone of the Thumb. The <i>Brevior</i>
  hath the same Origin with the <i>Longior</i>, keeps the same Track,
  passes under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament, and is terminated in the third
  Thumb-Bone. <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Thenar</i> removes the Thumb from the Fingers, and forms that
  part which is call'd the <i>Mount of Venus</i>: It hath its Source in the
  first Bone of the <i>Carpus</i> or Wrist, and the <i>Annular</i>
  Ligament, and is inserted in its second Bone.</p>

  <p>The <i>Antithenar</i> draws the Thumb to the other Fingers, having its
  Origine in the Bone of the <i>Metacarpus</i>, that stayeth the middle
  Finger, and its Insertion is in the first Bone of the Thumb.</p>

  <p>The Muscle which serves to extend the Fore-Finger, is call'd
  <i>Indicator</i>: It proceeds from the middle and outer part of the
  <i>Cubitus</i>, and is fixt by a double <i>Tendon</i> in the second
  Articulation of the Fore-Finger, as also in the <i>Tendon</i> of the
  great <i>Extensor</i> of the Fingers.</p>

  <p>That which draws the Fore-Finger to the Thumb is term'd
  <i>Adductor</i>: It commenceth in the fore-part of the first Thumb-Bone,
  and is terminated in the Bones of the Fore-Finger.</p>

  <p>That which removes the Fore-Finger from the Thumb is known by the Name
  of <i>Abductor</i>, which arising out of the external and middle part of
  the Bone of the Elbow, and passing under the <i>Annular</i> Ligament,
  cleaves to the Lateral and outward part of the Bones of the
  Fore-Finger.</p>

  <p>The Little-Finger hath two proper Muscles, <i>viz.</i> an
  <i>Extensor</i> and an <i>Abductor</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Extensor</i> springs from the lower part of the <i>Condylus</i>
  of the Arm-Bone, and is fasten'd by a double <i>Tendon</i> in the second
  Articulation of the Little-Finger, and in the <i>Tendon</i> of the
  <i>Extensor</i> of all the others. <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Abductor</i>, call'd also <i>Hypothenar</i>, hath its beginning
  in the small Bone of the Wrist, which is situated over the others, and is
  terminated in the first Bone of the Little-Finger on the outside.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XI.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Muscles of the Thighs, Legs,
and Feet.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Motions of the Thighs?</i></p>

  <p>The Thigh performs five kinds of Motions; for it is bent, extended,
  drawn within side and without, and turn'd round: All these Motions are
  produc'd by the means of fourteen Muscles, <i>viz.</i> three
  <i>Flexors</i>, three <i>Extensors</i>, three <i>Adductors</i>, three
  <i>Abductors</i>, and two <i>Obturators</i> for the Circular Motion.</p>

  <p>The <i>Flexors</i> of the Thigh are the <i>Psoas</i>, <i>Iliacus</i>,
  and <i>Pectineus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Psoas</i> or <i>Lumbaris</i> is situated inwardly in the
  <i>Abdomen</i>, on the side of the <i>Vertebra's</i>. It proceeds from
  the transverse <i>Apophyses</i> of the two lower <i>Vertebra's</i> of the
  Back, and of the upper of the Loins, and lying on the inner Face of the
  <i>Os Ilion</i>, sticks to the lesser <i>Trochanter</i> or
  <i>Rotator</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Iliacus Internus</i> hath its Origine in all the Lips of the
  inner Cavity of the <i>Os Ilion</i>, and being joyn'd by a <i>Tendon</i>
  to the <i>Lumbaris</i>, is inserted with it in the lesser
  <i>Trochanter</i>. <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Pectineus</i> takes its rise from the fore-part of the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, and is united before to the Thigh-Bone a little below the
  lesser <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Extensors</i> of the Thigh are the <i>Glutæus Major</i>,
  <i>Medius</i>, and <i>Minimus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Glutæus Major</i> springs forth out of the lateral part of the
  <i>Os Sacrum</i>, as also the hinder and outer part of the <i>Os
  Ilion</i> and <i>Coccyx</i>, and enters into the Thigh-Bone, four Fingers
  breadth below the great <i>Trochanter</i> or <i>Rotator</i>, being the
  thickest of all the Muscles of the Body.</p>

  <p>The <i>Glutæus Medius</i>, deducing its Original from the hinder and
  outward part of the <i>Os Ilion</i>, is inserted three Fingers breadth
  below the great <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Glutæus Minimus</i> ariseth from the bottom of the Cavity of
  the <i>Os Ilion</i>, and is fasten'd to a small Hole near the great
  <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Adductors</i> of the Thigh are the <i>Triceps Superior,
  Medius</i>, and <i>Inferior</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Triceps Superior</i> hath its beginning in the top of the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, and is terminated in the top of a Line, which is on the inside
  of the Thigh.</p>

  <p>The <i>Triceps Medius</i> proceeding from the middle of the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, is inserted in the Thigh-Bone a little lower than the
  <i>Triceps Superior</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Triceps Inferior</i> hath its Source in the bottom of the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, and is implanted in the Thigh-Bone, a little lower than the
  <i>Triceps Medius</i>. Some Anatomists make only one Muscle of these
  three, attributing thereto three Originals and three Insertions. These
  Muscles serve to draw the Thighs one against another.</p>

  <p>The <i>Abductors</i> of the Thigh are the <i>Iliacus Externus</i>, or
  <i>Pyriformis</i>, the <i>Quadratus</i>, and the <i>Gemelli</i>. <!--
  Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Pyriformis</i> arising from the upper and lateral part of the
  <i>Os Sacrum</i>, and the the <i>Os Ilion</i> cleaves to the Neck of the
  great <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Quadratus</i> or square Muscle of the Thigh takes its Origine
  from the external Prominence of the <i>Os Ischion</i>, and adheres to the
  outward part of the great <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Gemelli</i> or Twin Muscles arise from two small Knobs in the
  hinder-part of the <i>Ischion</i> and insinuate themselves into a small
  Cavity in the Neck of the great <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p>The Circular Motion of the Thigh is performed by the means of two
  Muscles, named the <i>Obturatores Externi</i> and <i>Interni</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Obturator Internus</i> springs from the inner Circumference of
  the Oval Hole of the <i>Ischion</i> and its <i>Tendons</i> passing
  between the two <i>Gemelli</i> are inserted in a small Cavity at the Root
  of the great <i>Trochanter</i> or <i>Rotator</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Obturator Externus</i> ariseth from the outward Circumference
  of the same Hole of one <i>Ischion</i>, and is terminated in the side of
  the other near the great <i>Trochanter</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Motions of the Leg, and what are its Muscles?</i></p>

  <p>The Leg is mov'd four several ways, that is to say, it is bent,
  extended, and drawn inward and outward, by the means of eleven Muscles
  <i>viz.</i> three <i>Flexors</i>, four <i>Extensors</i>, two
  <i>Adductors</i> and two <i>Abductors</i>.</p>

  <p>The three <i>Flexors</i> of the Leg are the <i>Biceps</i>, the
  <i>Semi-nervosus</i>, and the <i>Semi-membranosus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Biceps</i> hath two Heads, the longer whereof cometh out of the
  bottom of the Prominence <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>of the <i>Ischion</i>, and the other from
  the middle and exterior part of the <i>Femur</i>, and is terminated in
  the outward and upper part of the <i>Epiphysis</i> of the <i>Perone</i>
  or <i>Fibula</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Semi-nervosus</i> hath its Origine in the Knob of the
  <i>Ischion</i>, and is join'd backward to the top of the <i>Epiphysis</i>
  of the <i>Tibia</i>. These three Muscles are plac'd in the back-part of
  the Thigh below the Buttocks.</p>

  <p>The four <i>Extensors</i> of the Leg are the <i>Rectus</i>, the
  <i>Vastus Internus</i>, the <i>Vastus Externus</i>, and the
  <i>Crureus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Rectus</i> or streight Muscle of the Leg takes its rise from
  the fore-part and the bottom of the <i>Ilion</i>, and descends in a right
  Line: It covers with its <i>Tendon</i>, which is common to the three
  following, the whole Knee-Pan, and adheres to the top of the
  <i>Tibia</i>, on the fore-part.</p>

  <p>The <i>Vastus Internus</i>, being situated on the inside of the Thigh,
  hath its beginning in the top of the Thigh inwardly, and a little below
  the lesser <i>Trochanter</i> or <i>Rotator</i>: Afterward it is ty'd to
  the <i>Tibia</i> by a large <i>Tendon</i>, common thereto with the
  preceeding.</p>

  <p>The <i>Vastus Externus</i> is plac'd on the outside of the Thigh,
  springing from the top and the fore-part of the <i>Femur</i>, being
  united by the same <i>Tendon</i> with the two preceeding.</p>

  <p>The <i>Crureus</i> proceeds from the top, and the fore-part of the
  Thigh-Bone, between the two <i>Trochanters</i>; then covering the whole
  Bone, it is also fasten'd to the Leg-Bone with the three preceeding
  Muscles, after having cover'd the Knee-Pan with their common <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span><i>Tendon</i>,
  which serves likewise as a Ligament to the Knee.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Adductors</i> of the Leg are the <i>Sartorius</i> and the
  <i>Gracilis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sartorius</i> or the <i>Longissimus</i> draws the leg inward,
  deriving its Original from the upper <i>Spine</i> of the <i>Ischion</i>;
  from whence it descends obliquely thro' the inside of the Thigh, and
  cleaves to the top on the inside of the <i>Tibia</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Gracilis</i> hath its Origine in the fore-part at the bottom of
  the <i>Os Pubis</i>, and its Insertion in the top of the <i>Tibia</i> on
  the inside.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Abductors</i> of the Leg are the <i>Fascia lata</i>, and
  the <i>Poplitæus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Fascia lata</i>, or the <i>Membranosus</i>, is as it were a
  kind of large Band, which covers all the Muscles of the Thigh. It
  proceeds from the outward Lip of the <i>Os Ilion</i>, is ty'd by a large
  Membrane to the top of the <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i> and sometimes
  descends to the end of the Foot.</p>

  <p>The <i>Poplitæus</i>, or <i>Sub-poplitæus</i>, arises from the lower
  and external <i>Condylus</i> of the Thigh-Bone, passeth obliquely from
  the outside to the inside, till it is lost in the upper and inner part of
  the Leg-Bone under the Ham.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Motions of the Foot, and what are its Muscles?</i></p>

  <p>The Foot performs two Motions by the help of nine Muscles, as being
  bent by two, and extended by seven.</p>

  <p>The two <i>Flexors</i> are the <i>Crureus Anticus</i>, and the
  <i>Peronæus Anticus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Crureus</i> or <i>Tibiæus Anticus</i>, is plac'd along the
  <i>Tibia</i>, and takes its rise from its upper and fore-part: Afterward
  it is bound by two <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span><i>Tendons</i> to the first <i>Os
  Cuneiforme</i>, or Wedge-like Bone, and to that of the <i>Metatarsus</i>
  or Instep, which stayeth the great Toe, after having pass'd under the
  annular Ligament.</p>

  <p>The <i>Peronæus Anticus</i> springs from the middle and outward-part
  of the <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i>, and insinuating it self thro' the
  Cleft which is under the external <i>Malleolus</i> before, sticks to the
  Bone of the <i>Metatarsus</i> that supports the little Toe.</p>

  <p>The seven <i>Extensors</i> of the Foot are the two <i>Gemelli</i>, or
  the <i>Soleus</i>, the <i>Plantaris</i>, the <i>Crureus Posticus</i>, and
  the two <i>Peronæi Postici</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Gemelli</i> are the <i>Interior</i> and the <i>Exterior</i>;
  the former having its Source in the inner <i>Condylus</i>, and the other
  in the outward and lower of the Thigh-Bone; from whence they extend
  themselves till they are fasten'd to the <i>Talus</i> or Ankle-Bone by a
  <i>Tendon</i> common to them, with the two following.</p>

  <p>The <i>Soleus</i> ariseth from the top on the back-part of the
  Leg-Bone and <i>Perone</i>, and confounding its <i>Tendon</i> with that
  of the <i>Gemelli</i>, sticks close to the <i>Talus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Plantaris</i>, which lies hid between the <i>Gemelli</i> and
  the <i>Soleus</i>, hath its Origine from the <i>Exterior Condylus</i> of
  the Thigh-Bone; then uniting its <i>Tendon</i> with the preceeding, it
  adheres to them; and this common <i>Tendon</i> is call'd <i>Chorda
  Achillis</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Crureus</i> or <i>Tibiæus Posticus</i>, springs from the
  back-part of the Leg-Bone, from whence extending it self downward, it
  passeth thro' the Fissure in the <i>Internal Malleolus</i>, and cleaves
  to the inner-part of the <i>Os Scaphoides</i>. <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Peronæi</i>, or <i>Fibulæi Postici</i>, are otherwise call'd
  the <i>Longus</i> and the <i>Brevis</i>, whereof one proceeds from the
  upper and almost fore-part of the <i>Perone</i>, terminating in the
  upper-part of the Bone, that supports the great Toe in the
  <i>Metatarsus</i>, and the other from the lower part of the
  <i>Perone</i>, adhering in like manner to the Bone with which the little
  Toe is sustain'd.</p>

  <p><i>With what Motions are the Toes endu'd, how many Muscles have they,
  and which be they?</i></p>

  <p>The Toes are bent and extended, as also drawn inward and outward, by
  the means of twenty two Muscles, of which sixteen are Common, and six
  Proper. The former are two <i>Flexors</i>, two <i>Extensors</i>, four
  <i>Lumbricales</i>, and eight <i>Interossei</i>. The first <i>Flexor</i>
  is nam'd <i>Sublimis</i>, and the other <i>Profundus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sublimis</i> or <i>Perforatus</i> derives its Original from the
  lower and inner-part of the <i>Talus</i> and is fixt in its proper place
  by four cleft <i>Tendons</i>, which are inserted in the upper-part of the
  Bones of the first <i>Phalanx</i> of the four Toes. It is situated under
  the Sole of the Feet.</p>

  <p>The <i>Profundus</i> or <i>Perforans</i> hath its beginning in the top
  and back-part of the Leg-Bone and <i>Perone</i>, slips under the
  <i>Malleolus Internus</i> thro' the <i>Sinus Calcaris</i>, and makes four
  <i>Tendons</i> which pass thro' the Fissures of the <i>Tendon</i> of the
  <i>Sublimis</i>, and cleaves to the Bones of the last <i>Phalanx</i> of
  the Toes, to bow them.</p>

  <p>The first <i>Extensor</i> is call'd the <i>Common</i>, and the other
  the <i>Pediæus.</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Common Extensor</i>, or the <i>Longus</i>, takes its rise from
  the top and fore-part of the <i>Tibia</i> in the place of its joyning
  with the <i>Perone</i> or <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span><i>Fibula</i>, and divides it self into four
  <i>Tendons</i>, which after having pass'd under the Annular Ligament, are
  inserted in the Articulations of every Toe.</p>

  <p>The <i>Pediæus</i> or the <i>Brevis</i>, being plac'd over the Foot,
  proceeds from the Annular Ligament, and the lower-part of the
  <i>Perone</i>, and sends forth four <i>Tendons</i>, which are fixt to the
  first Articulation of the four Toes on the outside, Thus this Muscle,
  together with the <i>Longus</i>, causeth their Extension.</p>

  <p>The four <i>Lumbrical</i> Muscles of the Toes arise from the
  <i>Tendons</i> of the <i>Profundus</i>, and a Mass of Flesh at the Sole
  of the Feet. They are joyn'd by their <i>Tendons</i> with those of the
  <i>Interossei Interni</i>, and adhere inwardly to the side of the first
  Bones of the four Toes, to incline them toward the great Toe.</p>

  <p>The <i>Abductors</i>, or those Muscles that remove the Toes from the
  great Toe, are the eight <i>Interossei</i>, whereof four are call'd
  <i>Externi</i>, and as many <i>Interni</i>. The former take their rise in
  the Spaces between the Bones of the <i>Metatarsus</i>, and are terminated
  outwardly in the side of the first Bones of the Toes. The Internal lie in
  the bottom of the Foot, and take up the Spaces between the five Bones of
  the <i>Metatarsus</i>. They arise from the Bones of the <i>Tarsus</i>,
  and the Intervals between those of the <i>Metatarsus</i>, and are
  implanted with the four <i>Lumbricales</i> inwardly, in the upper-part of
  the Bones of the first <i>Phalanx</i> of the four Toes.</p>

  <p>Of the six Proper Muscles of the Toes, there are four appointed for
  the great Toe, which cause it to perform the Motions of Flexion, <!--
  Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>Extension, and drawing forward or backward.
  The two others are the <i>Adductor</i> of the second Toe to the great
  Toe, and the <i>Abductor</i> of the little Toe, call'd
  <i>Hypothenar</i>.</p>

  <p>The Proper <i>Flexor</i> of the great Toe, arises from the top of the
  <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i>, on the back part, passeth thro' the
  Ancle-Bone on the inside to the sole of the Foot, and is fasten'd to the
  Bone of the last <i>Phalanx</i>.</p>

  <p>The Proper <i>Extensor</i> of the great Toe springs from the middle of
  the fore-part of the <i>Perone</i>, passeth over the Foot, and hath its
  Insertion in the upper-part of the Bone of the great Toe.</p>

  <p>The Proper <i>Adductor</i> of the great Toe, or the <i>Thenar</i>,
  taking its rise inwardly on the side of the <i>Talus</i>, the <i>Ossa
  Schaphoidea</i> and <i>Innominata</i>, extends it self over the
  outward-part of the Bone of the <i>Metatarsus</i>, which stayeth the
  great Toe, and adheres to the top of the second Bone of the great Toe,
  which it draws inward.</p>

  <p>The proper <i>Abductor</i> of the great Toe, or the <i>Antithenar</i>,
  draws it toward the other Toes. It derives its Origine from the Bone of
  the <i>Metatarsus</i>, which supports the little Toe, slides obliquely
  over the other Bones, and cleaves to the first Bone of the great Toe on
  the inside.</p>

  <p>The <i>Adductor</i> appropriated to the second Toe hath its Source in
  the first Bone of the great Toe, on the inside, and sticks close to the
  Bones of the second Toe, which it draws to the great Toe. <!-- Page 57
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Abductor</i> of the little Toe, or the <i>Hypothenar</i>,
  proceeds from the outward part of the Bone of the <i>Metatarsus</i>, that
  stayeth the little Toe, and is inserted in the top of the little Toe, on
  the outside, to remove it from the others.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P. XII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Anatomy of the Nerves, Arteries,
and Veins in general.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is the Structure of the Nerves?</i></p>

  <p>The Nerves are round white Bodies enclos'd in a double Membrane,
  communicated to them from the two <i>Meninges</i> of the Brain: Their
  Office is to convey the Animal Spirits into all the Parts.</p>

  <p><i>Where is the Root and first beginning of all the Nerves?</i></p>

  <p>All the Nerves take their Original from the <i>Medulla Oblongata</i>,
  and that of the Spine.</p>

  <p><i>How is the distribution of them made thro' the whole Body?</i></p>

  <p>It is directly perform'd by Conjugations or Pairs, whereof one goes to
  the Right-hand, and the other to the Left: There are nine Pairs of them
  that proceed from the <i>Medulla Oblongata</i> and enter into the Skull;
  and a Tenth that comes from the Marrow which lies between the Occipital
  and the first <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck. It <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>passeth thro' the Hole of
  the <i>Dura Mater</i>, thro' which the Vertebral Artery enters, to
  distribute its Branches into several Parts.</p>

  <p><i>To what Use are the nine Pairs of Nerves appropriated, which
  proceed from the Root of the Brain?</i></p>

  <p>They are chiefly design'd for the Senses, and also for the Motion of
  their Organs, of which the Ancients discover'd only seven.</p>

  <p>The first Pair of Nerves is call'd the <i>Olfactory</i>, and serves
  for the Smelling.</p>

  <p>The second Pair is the <i>Optici</i> or <i>Visorii Nervi</i>, and
  bestows upon the Eyes the Faculty of seeing.</p>

  <p>The third is term'd <i>Motorii Oculorum</i>, being serviceable for the
  Motion of the Eyes.</p>

  <p>The fourth Pair is nam'd <i>Oculorum Pathetici</i>, which shews the
  Passion of the Mind in the Eyes, whereto it imparts a String as well as
  to the Lips.</p>

  <p>The fifth is call'd the <i>Gustative</i>, and appropriated to the
  Taste, because it sends Twigs more especially to the Tongue, as also to
  the Fore-head, Temples, Face, Nostrils, Teeth, and Privy-Parts.</p>

  <p>The Sixth is likewise for the Taste, and goes to the Palate.</p>

  <p>The seventh is the <i>Auditive</i> Nerve, that enters into the <i>Os
  Petrosum</i>, where it divides it self into many Branches, which when
  gone forth, are distributed to the Muscles of the Tongue, Lips, Mouth,
  Face, Fore-head, Eye-Lids, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The eighth is the <i>Os Vagum</i>, or wandering Pair, which is united
  to the Intercostal Nerve, as also to the Recurrent, Diaphragmatick,
  Mesenterick, &amp;c. <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span></p>

  <p>The ninth Pair, after having form'd a Trunk with the eighth,
  disperseth its Twigs several ways, whereof one is join'd with the Twig to
  the tenth, to be distributed together into the Muscle
  <i>Sternohyoideus</i>, and into the Tongue.</p>

  <p>The <i>Intercostal</i> and <i>Spinal</i> are not Pairs of Nerves, but
  only Branches or Twigs of other Pairs.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Distribution and Use of the thirty Pairs of Nerves that
  proceed from the Spinal Marrow?</i></p>

  <p>There are seven that go forth from the several <i>Vertebra's</i> of
  the Neck, twelve from those of the Back, five from the Loins, and six
  from the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, according to the following Progression.</p>

  <p>The first of the seven Pairs of Nerves of the Neck proceeds from
  between the Occipital Bone and the first <i>Vertebra</i>, nam'd
  <i>Atlas</i>, its Fibres being lost in the Muscles of the hinder-part of
  the Head and Neck.</p>

  <p>The second Pair springs from between the first and second
  <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck; the Fibres whereof are lost in the Muscles
  of the Head, and in the Skin of the Face.</p>

  <p>The third Pair issueth from between the second and third
  <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck; and its Fibres are lost in the Flexor
  Muscles and Extensors of the Neck.</p>

  <p>The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Pairs proceed from between the
  <i>Vertebra's</i>, as before, but their Fibres are lost in the Neck of
  the <i>Omoplata</i>, in the Arm, and in the <i>Diaphragme</i> or Midriff.
  Here it ought to be observ'd by the way that the Arms receive Branches
  not only from the <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>four last Pairs of the Nerves of the Neck,
  but also from the two first Pairs of the Back, which are extended even to
  the end of the Fingers: Whence it happens that in the Palsie of the Arms,
  Remedies are usually apply'd to the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Neck; and
  that in Phlebotomy or letting Blood, care must be taken to avoid pricking
  the Nerve, which accompanies the Basilick Vein in the Elbow.</p>

  <p>The twelve Pairs of Nerves that have their Beginning from between the
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back, are each of them divided into two
  Branches, as the others; and their Branches are distributed in like
  manner to the Muscles of the Breast, and to those of the Back and
  <i>Abdomen</i>.</p>

  <p>The five Pairs which take their Rise from between the
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Loins, have thicker Branches than the others,
  and the distribution of them is made to the Muscles of the Loins,
  <i>Hypogastrium</i>, and Thighs.</p>

  <p>Of the six Pairs of Nerves that proceed from the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, the
  four Upper with the three Lower of the Loins, send forth Fibres of Nerves
  to the Thigh, Leg, and Foot; and the two last Pairs impart Nerves to the
  <i>Anus</i>, Bladder, and privy Parts.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Structure of the Arteries?</i></p>

  <p>The Arteries are long and round Canals, consisting of four sorts of
  Tunicks or Membranes, which have their Rise from the left Ventricle of
  the Heart, from whence they receive the Blood, and convey it to all the
  Parts of the Body for their Nourishment.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Construction of these four Tunicks or Membranes of the
  Arteries?</i> <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span></p>

  <p>The first being thin and Nervous in its outward Superficies, is in the
  Inside a <i>Plexus</i> or Interlacement of small Veins and Arteries, and
  Fibres of Nerves, which enter into the other following Tunicks, to
  nourish them.</p>

  <p>The second sticking close to the former, is altogether full of whitish
  Glandules, that serve to separate the serous Particles of the Blood.</p>

  <p>The third is intirely Musculous, and interwoven with Annular
  Fibres.</p>

  <p>The fourth is very thin, and hath its Fibres all streight.</p>

  <p><i>Whence proceeds the Pulse or beating of the Arteries?</i></p>

  <p>It is deriv'd from the Heart, and exactly answers to its Motion of
  <i>Diastole</i> and <i>Systole</i>.</p>

  <p><i>By what Name is the first Trunk of the Arteries call'd, and what is
  the Effect of the Distribution made thence to the whole Body?</i></p>

  <p>The first Trunk of the Arteries is nam'd <i>Aorta</i>, or the <i>thick
  Artery</i>, which proceeds immediately from the left Ventricle of the
  Heart, whereto it communicates before its departure from the
  <i>Pericardium</i>, one or two small Branches call'd the <i>Coronary</i>:
  Afterward it is divided into two Branches, whereof one goes upward, and
  is term'd the <i>Ascending Artery</i>; and the other downward, under the
  Denomination of the <i>Descending Artery</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Ascending Artery</i> ariseth upward along the <i>Aspera
  Arteria</i> or Wind-Pipe, to the Clavicles, and is there divided into two
  Branches, call'd the <i>Subclavian Arteries</i>, one whereof goes forward
  to the Right side, and the other to the Left; and they both send forth on
  each side <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>divers Branches, which take their Names from
  the several Parts, whereto they are distributed; such are the
  <i>Carotides</i> or <i>Soporales Interni &amp; Externi</i>, which pass to
  the Head; the <i>Mediastina</i>; the <i>Intercostal</i>; the
  <i>Axillar</i>, and others.</p>

  <p>The <i>Descending Artery</i>, before its departure from the Breast,
  affords certain Branches to the <i>Pericardium</i>, Diaphragm, and lower
  Ribs; afterward it penetrates the Diaphragm, and constitutes seven double
  Branches. The first is of those that are call'd <i>C&oelig;liack</i>, and
  which go to the Liver and Spleen. The second Branch contains the <i>Upper
  Mesenterick</i>. The third the <i>Emulgent</i>, which pass to the Reins.
  The fourth the <i>Spermatick</i>, which are extended to the Genitals. The
  fifth the <i>Lower Mesenterick</i>. The sixth the <i>Lumbar</i>. And the
  seventh the <i>Muscular</i>. But assoon as the great Trunk is come
  downward to the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, it divides it self into two thick
  Arteries nam'd the <i>Iliack</i>, which are distributed on both sides,
  each of them making two Internal and External Branches, which likewise
  impart Sprigs or lesser Arteries, to the Bladder, <i>Anus</i>,
  <i>Matrix</i>, and other adjacent Parts: Then the Master-Branch forms the
  <i>Crural</i> Arteries on the inside of the Thighs, which are
  communicated by multiplying their Number even to the ends of the Toes, in
  passing over the External Ancle-Bones of the Feet.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Structure of the Veins?</i></p>

  <p>The Veins are long and round Canals made of four kinds of Tunicks or
  Membranes, whose Office it is to receive the Blood that remains after the
  Nourishment is taken, and to carry it back to the Heart to be reviv'd.
  <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is the Form of the four Tunicks that make the Canals of the
  Veins?</i></p>

  <p>The first is a Contexture of Nervous and streight Fibres. The second
  is a <i>Plexus</i> of small Vessels that carry the Nourishment. The third
  is all over beset with Glandules thro' which are filtrated the serous
  Particles of the Blood contain'd in the Vessels of the second Tunicle.
  The fourth is a Series of Annular and Musculous or Fleshy Fibres.</p>

  <p><i>Which are the most numerous, the Arteries or the Veins?</i></p>

  <p>The Number of the Veins exceeds that of the Arteries; and there are
  scarce any Arteries without Veins accompanying them.</p>

  <p><i>Where is the Beginning and Original of all the Veins?</i></p>

  <p>All the Veins have their Root in the Liver, and two of the three great
  Trunks that proceed from thence, are call'd <i>Vena Portæ</i>, and
  <i>Vena Cava</i>; and the third is twofold, <i>viz.</i> the
  <i>ascending</i> and the <i>descending</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Vena Portæ</i> is distributed to all the Parts contain'd in the
  lower Belly, and terminated in the Fundament; where it makes the Internal
  Hæmorrhoidal Veins.</p>

  <p>The <i>Vena Cava</i> is immediately divided into two thick Branches,
  one whereof ariseth upward to the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and forms
  the <i>ascending Vena Cava</i>; as the other goes downward to the Feet,
  and constitutes the <i>descending</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Distribution of the ascending </i>Vena Cava<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It perforates the Diaphragm, goes to the Heart, and ascends from
  thence to the Clavicles, <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>after having communicated to the Midriff in
  passing, a small Branch call'd the <i>Phrenicus</i>; as also one or two
  to the Heart, nam'd the <i>Coronary</i>; and some others to the upper
  Ribs, besides the single Branch, term'd <i>Azygos</i>, only on the right
  side. But the Trunk of the <i>ascending Vena Cava</i>, being once come up
  to the Clavicles, is divided into two Branches, well known by the Name of
  the <i>Subclavian</i>, one whereof Shoots forth toward the Right side,
  and the other toward the Left; and they both make various Ramifications
  like to those of the thick ascending Artery, by producing the
  <i>Cervicalis</i> or <i>Soporalis</i>, and the Internal and External
  <i>Jugulars</i> that go to the Head; as also the <i>Axillars</i>, which
  pass to the Arms and Shoulders, forming the <i>Cephalick</i>, the
  <i>Median</i>, and the <i>Basilick</i> on the inside of the Elbow.</p>

  <p>The <i>descending Vena Cava</i> in like manner accompanieth the
  Ramifications of the <i>Aorta</i>, or thick descending Artery, to the
  fourth <i>Vertebra</i> of the Loins, where it sends forth two Branches,
  nam'd the <i>Iliack</i>, one whereof goes to the Right side, and the
  other to the Left, both inwardly and outwardly; imparting divers Twigs or
  lesser Branches to all the Parts contain'd in the <i>Abdomen</i> or lower
  Belly, even as far as the Fundament, where it makes the External
  <i>Hæmorrhoidal</i> Veins. Afterward the outward Branch of the
  <i>Iliack</i> descends in the Thigh, to form the <i>Crural</i>, and
  others, as far as the <i>Saphæna</i>, together with those that are
  situated at the end of the Feet.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Anatomy of the </i>Abdomen<i>, or
lower Belly</i>.</h3>

  <p><i>What is the clearest Division of the Human Body into various Parts,
  and that which is most followed in the Anatomical Schools?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which constitutes three <i>Venters</i>, that is to say, the
  Upper, the Middle, and the Lower, which are the Head, the <i>Thorax</i>
  or Breast and the <i>Abdomen</i> or lower Belly, together with the
  Extremities, which are the Arms and Legs.</p>

  <p><i>What is the lower Belly?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Cavity of the Body that contains the nourishing parts, as the
  Reins, the Bladder, and all those that are appropriated to Generation in
  both Sexes.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be consider'd outwardly in the lower Belly?</i></p>

  <p>Its different Regions, and the several parts therein contain'd.</p>

  <p><i>What are these Regions?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Epigastrick</i>, the <i>Umbilical</i>, and the
  <i>Hypogastrick</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is their Extent?</i></p>

  <p>It is from the <i>Xyphoides</i> or Sword-like Cartilage to the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, the division whereof into three equal Parts, constitutes the
  three different Regions; the <i>Epigastrium</i> being the first upward,
  the <i>Umbilicus</i> the second, and the <i>Hypogastrium</i> the third.
  <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p><i>What Are the Parts contain'd in the </i>Epigastrium<i>, and what
  Place do they possess therein?</i></p>

  <p>The Parts contain'd in the <i>Epigastrium</i> are the Liver, the
  Spleen, the Stomach, and the <i>Pancreas</i> or Sweet-bread, which lies
  underneath: The Stomach takes up the middle before, the Liver being
  plac'd on the Right side, and the Spleen on the Left; so that these two
  sides of the Epigastrick Region, are call'd the Right and Left
  <i>Hypochondria</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What Parts are there contain'd in the Umbilical Region, and what is
  their situation?</i></p>

  <p>They are the most part of the thin Intestines or small Guts,
  <i>viz.</i> the <i>Duodenum</i>, the <i>Jejunum</i>, and the
  <i>Ileon</i>, which have their Residence in the middle, where they are
  encircled with a Portion of the two great Guts, <i>Cæcum</i> and
  <i>Colon</i>, that take possession of the Sides, otherwise call'd the
  Flanks. The Reins or Kidneys are also in this Place, above, and somewhat
  backward.</p>

  <p><i>What Parts are there contain'd in the </i>Hypogastrium<i>, and of
  what Place are they possest?</i></p>

  <p>The greater part of the thick-Guts, <i>C&oelig;cum</i>, and
  <i>Colon</i>, are enclos'd therein, with the entire <i>Rectum</i>; there
  is also a Portion of the <i>Ileon</i>, which hides it self in the sides
  of the <i>Ilia</i>, or Hip-Bones: In the middle under the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>, the Bladder is situated on the Gut <i>Rectum</i> in Men, and
  the <i>Matrix</i> in Women lies between the <i>Rectum</i> and
  Bladder.</p>

  <p><i>After what manner is the opening of a Corps or dead Body perform'd
  at a publick Dissection?</i> <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <p>It is begun with a Crucial Incision in the Skin from underneath the
  Throat downward, traversing from one side to another in the Umbilical
  Region; then this Skin is pull'd off at the four Corners, and the
  <i>Panicula Adiposa</i> is immediately discover'd: Under this Fat lies a
  Fleshy Membrane, call'd <i>Membrana Carnosa</i>; and after that, the
  common Membrane of all the Muscles of the lower Belly. Thus we have taken
  a View of what Anatomists commonly term the <i>five Teguments</i>, that
  is to say, the <i>Epiderma</i> or Scarf-Skin, the <i>Derma</i> or true
  Skin, the <i>Panicula Adiposa</i>, the <i>Panicula Carnosa</i> or
  <i>Membranus Carnosa</i>, and the common Membrane of the Muscles.</p>

  <p>The five Teguments being remov'd, we meet with as many Muscles on each
  side, <i>viz.</i> the descending Oblique, the ascending Oblique, the
  Transverse, the streight, and the Pyramidal, by the means whereof the
  Belly is extended and contracted. Afterwards appears a Membrane nam'd
  <i>Peritonæum</i>, which contains all the Bowels, and covers the whole
  lower Belly, being strongly fasten'd to the first and third
  <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back. The Fat skinny Net which lies immediately
  under the <i>Peritonæum</i>, is call'd <i>Epiploon</i> and
  <i>Omentum</i>, or the Caul; it floats over the Bowels, keeping them in a
  continual Suppleness necessary for their Functions, maintains the Heat of
  the Stomach, and contributes to Digestion.</p>

  <p>It remains to take an Account of the Bowels <i>viz.</i> the Stomach,
  Mesentery, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Bladder, and Guts, together with the
  Parts appointed for Generation, which in Men <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>are the Spermatick
  Vessels, the Testicles, and the <i>Penis</i>; and in Women, the
  Spermatick Vessels, the Testicles or Ovaries, the <i>Matrix</i>, and its
  <i>Vagina</i> or Neck.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Stomach?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Receptacle of the Aliments or Food convey'd thither thro'
  the <i>Oesophagus</i> or Gullet, which is a Canal, or kind of streight
  Gut that reacheth from the Throat to the Mouth of the Stomach. The
  Stomach it self is situated immediately under the <i>Diaphragm</i> or
  Midriff, between the Liver and the Spleen, having two Orifices, whereof
  the Left is properly call'd <i>Stomachus</i>, or the Upper, and the Right
  (at its other Extremity) <i>Pylorus</i>, or the lower Orifice. Its Figure
  resembleth that of a Bag-Pipe, and the greater part of its Body lies
  toward the Left side. It is compos'd of three Membranes, <i>viz.</i> one
  Common, which it receives from the <i>Peritonæum</i>; and two Proper; the
  two uppermost being smooth, and the innermost altogether wrinkled.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Pancreas<i> or Sweet-bread?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Fat Body, consisting of many Glandules wrapt up in the same
  Tunicle, being situated under the <i>Pylorus</i> or lower Orifice of the
  Stomach: It helps Digestion, and hath divers other uses; but its
  principal Office is to separate the serous Particles of the Blood, to be
  convey'd afterward into the Gut <i>Duodenum</i>, by a Canal or Passage,
  nam'd the <i>Pancreatick</i>. This Juice serves to cause the Chyle to
  ferment with the Choler, in order to remove the grosser Particles from
  those that ought to enter into the Lacteal Vessels.</p>

  <p><i>Into how many sorts are the Guts distinguish'd?</i> <!-- Page 70
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>There are two sorts, <i>viz.</i> the thin and the thick.</p>

  <p><i>How many thin or small Guts are there?</i></p>

  <p>Three; that is to say, the <i>Duodenum</i>, the <i>Jejunum</i>, and
  the <i>Ileon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many thick Guts are there?</i></p>

  <p>Three likewise; <i>viz.</i> the <i>C&oelig;cum</i>, the <i>Colon</i>,
  and the <i>Rectum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Why are some of them call'd thin Guts, and others thick?</i></p>

  <p>Because the thin are smaller, being appointed only to transport the
  Chyle out of the Stomach into the Reserver; whereas the thick are more
  large and stronger, serving to carry forth the gross Excrements out of
  the Belly.</p>

  <p><i>Are the six Guts of an equal length?</i></p>

  <p>No, the <i>Duodenum</i>, which is the first of the thin Guts, is only
  twelve Fingers breadth long. The <i>Jejunum</i>, being the second, so
  call'd because always empty, is five Foot long: The third is nam'd
  <i>Ileon</i>, by reason of its great Turnings which oblige it to pass to
  the <i>Os Ilion</i>, where it produceth a Rupture; it extends it self
  almost twenty Foot in length.</p>

  <p>The first of the thick Guts, known by the Name of <i>C&oelig;cum</i>,
  is very short, and properly only an <i>Appendix</i> or Bag of a Finger's
  length. That which follows is the <i>Colon</i>, being the largest of all,
  and full of little Cells, which are fill'd sometimes with Wind and other
  Matters that excite the Pains of the Colick. It encompasseth the thin
  Guts, in passing from the top to the bottom of the Belly, by the means of
  its great Circumvolutions, and is from eight to nine Foot long. The last
  is the <i>Rectum</i> or <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>streight Gut, so nam'd, because it goes
  directly to the Fundament: It is no longer than ones Hand, but it is
  fleshy, and situated upon the <i>Os Sacrum</i>, and the <i>Coccyx</i> or
  Rump-Bone.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Peristaltick<i> Motion of the Guts?</i></p>

  <p>It is the successive Motion and Undulation, whereby the Guts
  insensibly push forward from the top to the bottom, the Matters contain'd
  in them; and that Motion which on the contrary is perform'd from the
  bottom to the top, is term'd the <i>Antiperistaltick</i> as it happens in
  the <i>Iliack</i> Passion, or twisting of the Guts, call'd <i>Domine
  Miserere</i>, by reason of its intolerable Pain.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Mesentery?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of Membrane somewhat fleshy, which is join'd to the Spine
  in the bottom and middle of the Belly, and by its folding, keeps all the
  Guts steady in their place; it is all over beset with red, white, and
  Lymphatick Vessels; that is to say, those that carry the Blood, Chyle,
  and <i>Lympha</i>, which serves to cause this last to run more freely,
  and to ferment. Three notable Glandules are also observ'd therein, the
  greatest whereof lies in the middle, and is nam'd <i>Asellius's
  Pancreas</i>; the two other lesser are call'd <i>Lumbar</i> Glandules, as
  being situated near the Left Kidney. From each of these Glandules
  proceeds a small Branch; and both are united together to make the great
  <i>Lacteal</i> Vein, or <i>Thoracick</i> Canal. This Tube conveys the
  Chyle along the <i>Vertebra's</i> of the Back to the Left
  <i>Subclavian</i> Vein; from whence it passeth into the ascending <i>Vena
  Cava</i>, and descends in the Right Ventricle of the Heart, <!-- Page 72
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>where it assumes
  the form of Blood; from whence it passeth to the Lungs thro' the
  <i>Pulmonary</i> Artery; then it returns to the Heart thro' the
  <i>Pulmonary</i> Vein, and goes forth again thro' the Left Ventricle of
  the Heart, between the <i>Aorta</i> or great Artery, to be afterward
  distributed to all the Parts of the Body. This is the ordinary Passage
  for the Circulation of the Chyle, and the Sanguification of the
  Heart.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Liver?</i></p>

  <p>The Liver, being the thickest of all the Bowels, is plac'd in the
  Right <i>Hypochondrium</i>, at the distance only of a Fingers breadth
  from the Diaphragm; its Figure much resembling that of a thick piece of
  Beef: It is Convex on the outside, and Concave within; its Substance is
  soft and tender, its Colour and Consistence being like coagulated Blood:
  It is cleft at bottom, and divided into two Lobes, <i>viz.</i> one
  greater, and the other less: Its Office is to purifie the Mass of Blood
  by Filtration; and it is bound by two strong Ligaments, the first whereof
  adheres to the Diaphragm, and the second to the <i>Xiphoides</i> or
  Sword-like Cartilage. Two great Veins take their Rise from hence,
  <i>viz.</i> the <i>Vena Portæ</i>, and the <i>Vena Cava</i>, which form
  innumerable Branches, as it were Roots in the Body of the Liver. The
  Gall-Bladder is fasten'd to the hollow part thereof, and dischargeth its
  Choler into the Gut <i>Duodenum</i>, thro' the Vessels that bear the Name
  of <i>Meatus Choledochi</i>, or <i>Ductus Biliares.</i> This Choler is
  not a meer Excrement, but on the contrary of singular Use in causing the
  Fermentation of the Chyle, and bringing it to perfection. <!-- Page 73
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is the Spleen?</i></p>

  <p>The Spleen is a Bowel resembling a Hart's Tongue in shape, and
  situated in the Left <i>Hypochondrium</i>, over-against the Liver: Its
  length is about half a Foot, and its breadth equal to that of three
  Fingers; its Substance being soft, as that of the Liver, and its Colour
  like dark coagulated Blood: It is fasten'd to the <i>Peritonæum</i>, Left
  Kidney, Diaphragm, and to the Caul on the inside; as also to the Stomach
  by certain Veins, call'd <i>Vasa Brevia</i>; nevertheless these Ligatures
  do not hinder it from wandering here and there in the lower Belly, where
  it often changeth its place, and causeth many dreadful symptoms by its
  irregular Motions. Its Office is to Subtilize the Blood by cleansing and
  refining it.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Reins?</i></p>

  <p>The Reins or Kidneys are Parts of a Fleshy Consistence, harder and
  more firm than that of the Liver and Spleen: They are both situated in
  the sides of the Umbilical Region, upon the Muscle <i>Psoas</i>, between
  the two Tunicks of the <i>Peritonæum</i>; but the Right is lower than the
  Left: Their Shape resembleth that of a <i>French</i> Bean, and they
  receive Nerves from the Stomach, whence Vomitings are frequently
  occasion'd in the Nephritical Colicks: They are fasten'd to the Midriff,
  Loins, and <i>Aorta</i>, by the <i>Emulgent</i> Arteries; as also to the
  Bladder by the <i>Ureters</i>. The Right Kidney likewise adheres to the
  Gut <i>Cæcum</i>, and the Left to the <i>Colon</i>. Their Office is to
  filtrate or strain the Urine in the <i>Pelves</i> or Basons, which they
  have in the middle of their Body on the inside, and <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>to cause it to run thro'
  the Vessels call'd <i>Ureters</i> into the Bladder.</p>

  <p>Immediately above the Reins on each side, is a flat and soft Glandule,
  of the thickness of a Nut; they are nam'd <i>Renal Glandules</i>, or
  <i>Capsulæ Atribiliariæ</i>, because they contain a blackish Liquor,
  which (as they say) serves as it were Leaven for the Blood, to set it a
  fermenting.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Bladder?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Bason or Reserver of Urines, of a Membranous Substance as
  the Stomach, being plac'd in the middle of the Hypogastrick Region; so
  that it is guarded by the <i>Os Sacrum</i> behind, and by the <i>Os
  Pubis</i> before: Two Parts are to be distinguish'd therein, <i>viz</i>.
  its Bottom and Top; by its Membranous Bottom it is join'd to the Navel,
  and suspended by the means of the <i>Urachus</i>, and the two Umbilical
  Arteries which degenerate into Ligaments in adult Persons: As by its
  fleshy Neck, longer and crooked in Men, and shorter and streight in Women
  it cleaves to the <i>Intestinum Rectum</i> in the former, and to the Neck
  of the Womb in the latter. Lastly, its Office is to receive the Urines to
  keep them, and to discharge them from time to time.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Genitals in Men?</i></p>

  <p>They are the Spermatick Vessels, the Testicles, and the <i>Penis</i>.
  The Spermatick Vessels are a Vein and an Artery on each side; the former
  proceeding from the <i>Aorta</i>, or thick Artery of the Heart; and the
  other from the Branches of the <i>Vena Cava</i> of the Liver. These
  Arteries and Veins are terminated in the Body of the <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>Testicles, which
  are two in Number, enclos'd within the <i>Scrotum</i>.</p>

  <p>The Office of the Testicles is to filtrate the Seed, which is brought
  thither from all the parts of the Body, thro' the Spermatick Vessels,
  called <i>Præparantia</i>, and afterwards to cause it to pass thro'
  others nam'd <i>Deferentia</i>, to the <i>Vesiculæ Seminales</i>, from
  whence it is forc'd into the <i>Ureter</i>, thro' two small and very
  short Canals.</p>

  <p>The <i>Penis</i> or Yard is a Nervous and Membranous Part, well
  furnish'd with Veins and Arteries, containing in the middle the Canal of
  the <i>Ureter</i>: Its Extremity, which consists of a very delicate and
  spongy sort of Flesh, is call'd <i>Balanus</i>, or <i>Glans</i>, and the
  Nut, the Skin that covers it being nam'd the <i>Præputium</i>, or the
  Fore-Skin. Thus by the means of this swell'd Part, and stiff thro' the
  affluence of the Spirits, the Male injects his Seed into the
  <i>Matrix</i> of the Female, to propagate his Kind.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Parts appropriated to Generation in Women?</i></p>

  <p>They are the Spermatick Vessels, the Ovaries or Testicles, and the
  <i>Matrix</i>. The Spermatick Vessels are a Vein and an Artery on each
  side, as in Men: The Ovaries or Testicles, situated on the side of the
  bottom of the <i>Matrix</i>, are almost of the same bigness with those of
  Men, but of a round and flat Figure. The <i>Vesiculæ</i>, or little
  Bladders which they contain, are usually term'd <i>Ova</i> or Eggs by
  Modern Anatomists; and the Vessels that pass from these Testicles or
  Ovaries to the <i>Cornua</i> of the <i>Uterus</i>, are call'd
  <i>Deferentia</i> or <i>Ejaculatoria</i>. <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Matrix</i>, <i>Uterus</i> or Womb, is the principal Organ of
  Generation, and the place where it is perform'd, resembling the Figure of
  a Pear with its Head upward, and being situated between the Gut
  <i>Rectum</i> and the Bladder: It is of a fleshy and membranous
  Substance, retain'd in its place by four Ligaments, fasten'd to the
  bottom; whereof the two upper are large ones, proceeding from the Loins,
  and the two lower round, taking their Rise from the Groin, where they
  form a kind of Goose-Foot, which is extended to the <i>Os Pubis</i>, and
  the flat part of the Thighs; which is the cause that Women are in danger
  of Miscarrying when they fall upon their Knees.</p>

  <p>The Exterior Neck of the Womb, call'd <i>Vagina</i>, is made almost in
  form of a Throat or Gullet, extending it self outwardly to the sides of
  the Lips of the <i>Pudendum</i>, and being terminated inwardly at the
  internal Orifice of the <i>Matrix</i>, the shape whereof resembleth that
  of the Muzzle or Nose of a little Dog. The outward Neck of the womb is
  fasten'd to the Bladder and the <i>Os Pubis</i> before, and in the hinder
  part to the <i>Os Sacrum</i>: Between the Lips of the <i>Pudendum</i> lie
  the <i>Nymphæ</i>, which are plac'd at the Extremity of the Canal of the
  Bladder, to convey the Urines; and somewhat farther appear four
  Caruncles, or small pieces of Flesh, at the Entrance of the
  <i>Vagina</i>, which when join'd together make the thin Membrane call'd
  <i>Hymen</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Anatomy of the </i>Thorax<i>, Breast,
or middle </i>Venter<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is the Breast?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Cavity in which the Heart and the Lungs are principally
  enclos'd.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be consider'd outwardly in the Breast?</i></p>

  <p>Its extent, and the situation of the Parts therein contain'd.</p>

  <p><i>What is its extent?</i></p>

  <p>It is extended from the <i>Clavicles</i> to the <i>Xiphoides</i>, or
  Sword-like Cartilage on the fore-part, and bounded on the hinder by the
  twelfth <i>Vertebra</i> of the Back, having all the Ribs to form its
  Circumference, and the Diaphragm for its Bounds at bottom, separating it
  from the <i>Abdomen</i> or lower Belly.</p>

  <p><i>What is the situation of the Parts contain'd in the Breast?</i></p>

  <p>The Lungs take up the upper Region, and fill almost the whole Space,
  descending at the distance of two Fingers breadth from the Diaphragm; the
  Heart is situated in the middle, bearing its Point somewhat towards the
  Left side, under the Lobes of the Lungs, which are divided by the
  <i>Mediastinum</i> that distinguishes them into the Right and Left
  Parts.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Breast Anatomiz'd or open'd?</i> <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span></p>

  <p>After the dissection of the five Teguments, and the removal of the
  Muscles, as in the lower Belly, the Anatomist proceeds to lift up the
  <i>Sternum</i> or Breast-Bone, by separating it from the Ribs; then it is
  laid upon the Face, or else entirely taken away, to the end that the
  internal Parts of the Breast may be more clearly discover'd; whereupon
  immediately appear, the Heart, the Lungs, the Diaphragm, and the
  <i>Mediastinum</i>, which sticks to the <i>Sternum</i> throughout its
  whole length.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Heart?</i></p>

  <p>It is a most noble Part, being the Fountain of Life, and the first
  Original of the Motion of all the others; on which account it is call'd
  <i>Primus vivens</i>, &amp; <i>ultimum moriens</i>; that is to say, the
  first Member that begins to live, and the last that dies.</p>

  <p><i>What Parts are to be consider'd in the Heart?</i></p>

  <p>Its fleshy Substance, with all its Fibres turn'd round like the Skrews
  of a Vice; its <i>Basis</i>, Point, Auricles, Ventricles, large Vessels,
  <i>Pericardium</i> and Ligatures or Tyes: The <i>Basis</i> is the
  uppermost and broadest part; the Point is the lowermost and narrowest
  part; the two Auricles or small Ears being as it were little Cisterns or
  Reservers, that pour the Blood by degrees into the Heart, are situated on
  each side above the Ventricles. The Ventricles, which are likewise two in
  Number, are certain Cavities in its Right and Left Sides. The large
  Vessels are the <i>Aorta</i> or great Artery, and the <i>Vena Cava</i>
  together with the Pulmonary Artery and Vein. The <i>Pericardium</i> is a
  kind of Bag fill'd with Water, wherein the Heart is kept; which is <!--
  Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span>fasten'd
  to the <i>Mediastinum</i> by its <i>Basis</i>, and to the large Vessels
  that enter and go out of its Ventricles.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Terms appropriated to the continual beating of the
  Heart?</i></p>

  <p>They are <i>Diastole</i> and <i>Systole</i>, from whence proceed two
  several Motions, the first whereof is that of Dilatation, and the other
  of Contraction, communicated to all the Arteries which have the same
  Pulse.</p>

  <p><i>To what use serves the Water contain'd in the
  </i>Pericardium<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It prevents the drying of the Heart by its perpetual Motion.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Lungs?</i></p>

  <p>They are an Organ serving for Respiration, of a soft Substance, and
  porous as a Sponge, being all over beset with Arteries, Veins, Nerves,
  and Lymphatick Vessels, and perforated with small Cartilaginous Tubes,
  that are imparted to it from the Wind-Pipe, and are call'd
  <i>Bronchia</i>. Their Natural Colour is a pale Red, and marbl'd dark
  Brown; and their whole Body is wrapt up in a fine smooth Membrane, which
  they receive from the <i>Pleuron</i>. They are suspended by the
  Wind-Pipe, by their proper Artery and Vein, and by the Ligatures that
  fasten them to the <i>Sternum</i>, <i>Mediastinum</i>, and frequently to
  the <i>Pleuron</i> it self: They are also divided into the Right and Left
  Parts by the <i>Mediastinum</i>; having four or five Lobes, whereof those
  on the Left side cover the Heart. Their continual Motion consists in
  <i>Inspiration</i>, to take in the Air, and <i>Expiration</i>, to drive
  it out. The <i>Larynx</i> makes the Entrance of the Wind-Pipe <!-- Page
  80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>into the
  Lungs, and the <i>Pharynx</i> that of the <i>Oesophagus</i> or Gullet, at
  the bottom of the Mouth to pass into the Stomach.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XV.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Anatomy of the Head, or
upper </i>Venter<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is the head?</i></p>

  <p>It is a bony Part, that contains and encloseth the Brain within its
  Cavity.</p>

  <p><i>What is most remarkable in the outward parts of the Head?</i></p>

  <p>The Temporal Arteries, the <i>Crotaphitæ</i>, or Temporal Muscles, and
  the Sutures of the Skull.</p>

  <p><i>Why are these things considerable?</i></p>

  <p>The Temporal Arteries are of good Note, because they are expos'd on
  the outside, lying even with the Skin. The <i>Crotophite</i> Muscles are
  so likewise, in regard that they cannot be hurt without danger of
  Convulsions, by reason of the <i>Pericranium</i> with which they are
  cover'd. And the Sutures, because the <i>Meninges</i> of the Brain
  proceed from thence to form the <i>Pericranium.</i></p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Pericranium<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Membrane that lies under the thick hairy Skin of the Head, and
  immediately covers the Skull.</p>

  <p><i>What are the </i>Meninges<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are two Membranes that enclose the Substance or Marrow of the
  Brain.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Suture?</i> <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span></p>

  <p>It is a kind of thick Seam or Stitch, that serves to unite the Bones
  of the Skull.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Sutures are there?</i></p>

  <p>There are two sorts, <i>viz.</i> the true, and the false or
  Bastard.</p>

  <p><i>What are the true Sutures?</i></p>

  <p>They are three in number, namely the <i>Sagittal</i>, the
  <i>Coronal</i>, and the <i>Lambdoidal.</i></p>

  <p><i>What is the disposition or situation of the true Sutures?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Sagittal</i> is streight, beginning in the middle of the
  Fore-head, and sometimes at the root of the Nose, and being terminated
  behind, at the joining of the two Branches of the <i>Lambdoidal
  Suture</i>.</p>

  <p>The Coronal appears in form of a Crown, passing to the middle of the
  Head, and descending thro' the Temples, to finish its Circumference in
  the Root of the Nose.</p>

  <p>The <i>Lambdoidal</i> Suture is made like an open Pair of Compasses,
  the Legs whereof are extended toward the Shoulders; and the Button is in
  the top of the Head backward.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Bastard Sutures?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that are call'd <i>Squamous</i> or scaly.</p>

  <p><i>What is the disposition of natural situation of these false
  Sutures?</i></p>

  <p>They are plac'd at the two sides of the Head, and make a Semi-Circle
  of the bigness of the Ears, round the same Ears.</p>

  <p><i>What difference is there between the true and spurious
  Sutures.</i></p>

  <p>The true Sutures are made in form of the Teeth of a Saw, which enter
  one into the other; and the false or Bastard ones are those that resemble
  the Scales of Fishes, which <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>are join'd together by passing one over the
  other.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Use of the Sutures?</i></p>

  <p>The Ancients were of Opinion, that they were made to hinder the
  Fracture of one Skull-Bone from passing thro' the whole Head; but there
  is more reason to believe that they have the three following Uses, that
  is to say, 1. To promote the transpiration of the Brain. 2. To give
  Passage to the Vessels that go to the <i>Diploe</i>. 3. To retain the
  <i>Meninges</i>, and to support the Mass of the Brain, which is cover'd
  by them.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Names of the Bones that compose the Skull?</i></p>

  <p>The Bone of the fore-part of the Head is call'd <i>Sinciput</i>, or
  the Fore-head-Bone, as also the <i>Frontal</i> or <i>Coronal</i> Bone.
  The Bone of the hinder-part, enclos'd within the <i>Lambdoidal</i>
  Suture, is term'd the <i>Occipital.</i> The two Bones that form the
  upper-part, and are distinguish'd by the Sagittal Suture, bear the Name
  of <i>Parietals</i>, one being on the Right side, and the other on the
  Left. And those behind the Ears are call'd <i>Temporal</i>,
  <i>Squamosa</i>, or <i>Petrosa</i>. These also are distinguish'd into the
  Right and Left Temporals, and are join'd to the bottom of the Parietal by
  a bastard squamous Suture.</p>

  <p><i>What is most remarkable in the thickness of the
  Skull-Bones?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Diploe</i>, which is nothing else but a <i>Plexus</i> or
  Contexture of small Vessels, that nourish the Bones, and in the middle of
  their thickness make the distinction of the first and second Tablature of
  the Bones; whence it sometimes <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>happens that an exfoliative Trepan, or
  Semi-Trepan, is sufficient, when the first of these two Tables is only
  broken, the other remaining entire.</p>

  <p><i>Is the Brain which is preserv'd in the Skull all of one Piece, or
  one equal Mass?</i></p>

  <p>No, it is distinguish'd by the means of the <i>Meninges</i> into the
  Brain it self, and the <i>Cerebellum</i> or little Brain; the Brain,
  properly so called, takes up almost the whole Cavity of the Skull, and
  the <i>Cerebellum</i> is lodg'd altogether in the hinder-part, where it
  constitutes only one entire Body; whereas the former is divided into the
  Right and Left Parts by the <i>Meninges</i>, which cut it even to the
  bottom; whence these Foldings are call'd <i>Falx</i>; i. e. a
  <i>Scythe</i> or <i>Sickle</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is chiefly remarkable in the Substance of the Brain?</i></p>

  <p>The Ventricles or Cavities which are found therein, together with the
  great Number of Veins, Arteries, Lymphatic Vessels, and Nerves, that
  carry Sense to all the Parts of the Body, and Spirits for their
  Motion.</p>

  <p><i>An exact Historical Account of all the Holes of the Skull, and the
  Vessels that pass thro' them.</i></p>

  <p>To attain to an exact Knowledge of all the Holes with which the inside
  of the <i>Basis</i> of the Skull is perforated, they are to be consider'd
  either with respect to the Nerves, or to the Sanguinary Vessels. <!--
  Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span></p>

  <p>There are nine Pairs of Nerves that arise from the <i>Medulla
  Oblongata</i>, and go forth out of the Skull through many Holes hereafter
  nam'd.</p>

  <p>The first Pair is that of the <i>Olfactory</i> Nerves, appropriated to
  the Sense of Smelling, which are divided below the <i>Os Cribiforme</i>,
  or Sieve-like Bone, into divers Threads, that passing into the Nose
  through many Holes with which this Bone is pierc'd, are distributed to
  the inner Tunick of the Nose.</p>

  <p>The second Pair is that of the <i>Optick</i> or Visual Nerves, that
  pass into the Orbits of the Eyes, thro' certain peculiar Holes made in
  the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, or Wedge-like Bone, immediately above the
  <i>Anterior Apophysis Clinoides</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Portion of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, that makes the
  <i>Basis</i> of the Orbit, lies a Fissure about seven or eight Hairs
  breadth long, which is to be observ'd chiefly at the bottom, that is to
  say, below the Hole, thro' which the Optick Nerve passeth; where it is
  almost round, and larger than at the top, where it is terminated in a
  very long and acute Angle.</p>

  <p>There are many Pairs of Nerves that enter into the Orbit thro' this
  Fissure, <i>viz.</i> 1. The third Pair, call'd the <i>Motorii
  Oculorum</i>. 2. The fourth Pair, nam'd <i>Pathetici</i>, by Dr.
  <i>Willis</i>. And 3. The whole sixth Pair. Besides these three Pairs,
  which go entire thro' this Cleft, there is also a Passage for the upper
  Branch of the foremost Fibre of the fifth Pair, which the same renowned
  Physician calls the <i>Ophthalmick</i> Branch. Beyond the lower-part of
  the said Fissure, toward the hinder-part of the Head, is to be seen <!--
  Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>in the
  <i>Os Sphenoides</i> on each side, a Hole that doth not penetrate the
  <i>Basis</i> of the Skull, but makes a kind of <i>Ductus</i>, about an
  Hair's breadth long, which is open'd behind the Orbit on the top of the
  Space between the <i>Apophysis Pterygoides</i>, and the third Bone of the
  Jaw; thro' this <i>Ductus</i> runs the lower Branch of the foremost Fibre
  of the fifth Pair.</p>

  <p>About the length of two Hairs breadth beyond these <i>Ductus's</i>, we
  may also discover in the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, or Wedge-like Bone, two
  Holes of an Oblong and almost Oval Figure, which are plac'd in the
  hindermost sides of that of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, and gives passage
  to the hindermost Fibre of the fifth Pair.</p>

  <p>The Hole thro' which runs the <i>Auditory</i> Nerve, that makes the
  seventh Pair, is in the middle of the hinder-part of the <i>Os
  Petrosum</i>, that looks toward the <i>Cerebellum</i>: This Hole being
  very large, is the Entrance of a <i>Ductus</i> that is hollow'd in the
  <i>Os Petrosum</i>, and which sinking obliquely from the fore-part
  backward, for the depth of about two Hairs breadth, forms as it were the
  bottom of a Sack, the lowermost part whereof is terminated partly by the
  <i>Basis</i> of the <i>Cochlea</i>, and partly by a Portion of the Mouth
  of the <i>Vestibulum</i>. At the bottom of this <i>Ductus</i> are many
  Holes, but the most considerable is that of the upper-part, thro' which
  passeth a Portion of the Auditory Nerve. This is also the Entrance of
  another <i>Ductus</i> made in the <i>Os Petrosum</i>, which is open'd
  between the <i>Apophysis Mastoides</i> and <i>Styloides</i>: These other
  Holes afford a Passage to the Branches of the soft Portion of the same
  Auditory Nerve. <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span></p>

  <p>Below this <i>Ductus</i> there is a remarkable Hole form'd by the
  meeting of two hollow Cuts the larger whereof is in the Occipital Bone
  and the other in the lower-part of the <i>Apophysis Petrosi</i>: From the
  middle of the upper-part of this Hole issueth forth a small Prominence or
  bony Point, whereto is join'd an Appendix of the <i>Dura Mater</i>, which
  divides the Hole into two parts; so that thro' the foremost Orifice
  passeth the Nerve of the eighth Pair, and that which is call'd the
  <i>Spinal</i> Nerve. We shall have occasion hereafter to shew the Use of
  the hinder Orifice.</p>

  <p>Near the great Hole of the Occipital Bone from whence proceeds the
  <i>Medulla Oblongata</i>, we may observe a Hole almost round and oblong
  thro' which passeth the Nerve of the ninth Pair. This Hole is entirely
  situated in the Occipital Bone, and making a little Way in the Bone
  passeth obliquely from the back-part forward. In the inside of the Skull
  this Hole is sometimes double, but its two Entrances are re-united in the
  outward-part of the Skull; and the two Branches that form the Origine of
  this Nerve and which pass thro' these two Holes, are likewise re-united
  at their Departure, These are the Passages of the nine Pairs of Nerves
  that proceed from the <i>Medulla Oblongata</i>, and it remains only to
  show that Paths thro' which the Intercostal Nerve goes forth, as also
  that of the tenth Pair. The Intercostal runs out of the Skull thro' the
  <i>Ductus</i> that gives Entrance to the Internal <i>Carotick</i> Artery.
  As for the tenth Pair, in regard that it ariseth from the Marrow which is
  enclos'd between the Occipital <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>Bone and the first <i>Vertebra</i>, it goes
  forth thro' the Hole of the <i>Dura Mater</i>, where the Vertebral Artery
  enters.</p>

  <p>To know well the Holes thro' which the Vessels that belong to the
  inner-part of the Head enter, and issue forth, it is requisite to
  distinguish them into those which are distributed to the <i>Dura
  Mater</i>, and those that are appointed for the Brain. The Vessels of the
  <i>Dura Mater</i>, are Branches of the <i>Carotick</i> or Vertebral
  Arteries.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, or Wedge-like Bone, behind the Hole thro'
  which passeth the hindermost Fibre of the fifth Pair of Nerves lies
  another small Hole, almost round, that gives Entrance to a Branch of the
  <i>External Carotick</i> Artery, which in entring, immediately adheres to
  the <i>Dura Mater</i>, and forms many Ramifications to overspread the
  whole Portion of this Membrane, which covers the sides, and the
  upper-part of the Brain.</p>

  <p>At the bottom and top of the lateral outward part of the Orbit of the
  Eye, above the acute Angle, for want of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, there
  is a Hole thro' which passeth an Artery, being a Twig of a Branch of the
  <i>Internal Carotick</i>, which is diffus'd in the Eye, and distributed
  to almost the whole Portion of the <i>Dura Mater</i>, that covers the
  fore-part of the Brain.</p>

  <p>The Vertebral Artery in entring into the Skull, furnisheth it on each
  side with a considerable Branch, which is dispers'd throughout the whole
  Portion of the <i>Dura Mater</i> that covers the <i>Cerebellum</i>. <!--
  Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

  <p>As for the Veins that accompany these Arteries, they almost all go out
  of the Skull thro' the same Holes where the other enters.</p>

  <p>There are four thick Arteries which convey to the Brain the Matter
  with which it is nourish'd, and that whereof the Spirits are form'd,
  <i>viz.</i> the two <i>Internal Caroticks</i>, and the two
  <i>Vertebrals.</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Internal Carotick</i> Arteries enter into the Skull thro a
  particular <i>Ductus</i> made in the Temporal Bone, the Mouth thereof
  being of an Oval Figure and situated in the outward part of the
  <i>Basis</i> of the Skull, before the Hole of the <i>Internal
  Jugular.</i> This <i>Ductus</i> extends it self obliquely from the
  back-side forward, and after having made about three Hairs breadth in
  length, is terminated in the hinder-part of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>. The
  Artery traverseth the whole winding Compass of this <i>Ductus</i>, which
  resembles the Figure of the <i>Roman</i> Letter S, and at the Mouth of
  the same <i>Ductus</i> runs under the <i>Dura Mater</i> along the sides
  of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i> to the <i>Anterior Apophyses Clinoides</i>,
  where it riseth up again, to perforate the <i>Dura Mater</i>, and to
  adhere to the Root of the Brain. These Vessels, in like manner, after
  their departure from the Bone of the Temples to the place where they
  pierce the <i>Dura Mater</i>, make a second Circuit in form of the
  <i>Roman</i> Character S. At the place where these <i>Carotick</i>
  Arteries penetrate the <i>Dura Mater</i>, they send forth a thick Branch,
  which enters into the Orbit of the Eye, by the lower-part of the Hole,
  thro' which the <i>Optick</i> Nerve hath its Passage. <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span></p>

  <p>The <i>Vertebral</i> Arteries proceeding from the Holes of the
  transverse <i>Apophyses</i> of the first <i>Vertebra</i>, turn about in
  passing under the upper oblique <i>Apophyses</i> of the seven
  <i>Vertebra's</i>: Afterward they perforate the <i>Dura Mater</i>, and
  running under the Marrow, enter into the Skull thro' the Occipital Hole;
  then inclining one toward another, they are re-united, and form only one
  single Trunk.</p>

  <p>The Veins that bring back the Blood from the Substance of the Brain,
  are emptied into the <i>Sinus's</i> of the <i>Dura Mater</i>, which are
  all discharg'd into those that are call'd <i>Lateral</i>, which last go
  out of the Skull immediately under the Nerves of the eighth Pair, thro'
  the hinder-part of the Hole made by the meeting of the <i>Occipital</i>
  Bone, and the <i>Apophysis Petrosa</i>. These Lateral <i>Sinus's</i> fall
  into the <i>Internal Jugulars</i>, which are receiv'd into a considerable
  Sinking hollow'd on each side in the outward, part of the <i>Basis</i> of
  the Skull, which is nam'd the Pit or Hole of the <i>Internal
  Jugular</i>.</p>

  <p>In the upper and hinder-part of the Hole, from whence the lateral
  <i>Sinus's</i> issue forth, is to be seen an opening in the Extremity of
  a <i>Ductus</i>, the Mouth whereof lies behind the <i>Condyli</i>, which
  are on the sides of the Occipital Trunk: This <i>Ductus</i> is extended
  about the length of two Hairs breadth in the Bone, and the Canal enclos'd
  therein is open'd immediately into the <i>Vertebral Sinus</i>: So that
  one might affirm it to be as it were its Original Source. Whence it
  appears that the Blood contained in the lateral <i>Sinus's</i> is emptied
  thro' two places; the greater Portion thereof descending in the
  <i>Jugulars</i> <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>from the Neck, and the other in the
  <i>Vertebral Sinus's</i>: Sometimes those <i>Ductus's</i> are four only
  on one side, another while both are stopt up, and the Blood contain'd in
  the lateral <i>Sinus's</i> is discharg'd into the <i>Internal
  Jugulars</i>.</p>

  <p>Behind the <i>Apophysis Mastoides</i> on each side is a remarkable
  Hole, thro' which passeth a thick Vein, which brings back part of the
  Blood that hath been distributed to the Teguments and Muscles, which
  cover part of the <i>Occiput</i> or hinder-side of the Head: This Vein is
  open'd into the lateral <i>Sinus's</i> at the place where they begin to
  turn about. But in the Heads of some Persons, this Hole is found only on
  one side, and even sometimes not at all, in which case the Blood
  contain'd in the Vessels falls into the <i>External Jugulars</i>, with
  which the Branches of this Vein have a Communication.</p>

  <p>In each <i>Parietal</i> Bone on the side of the <i>Sagittal</i>
  Suture, at a little distance from the <i>Lambdoidal</i>, appears a Hole,
  thro' which passeth a Vein, that brings back the Blood of the Teguments
  of the Head, and dischargeth it self into the upper <i>Longitudinal
  Sinus</i>. These Holes are sometimes on both; and then the Blood
  contain'd in the Branches of this Vein runs into the <i>External
  Jugulars</i>.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the <i>Sella</i> of the <i>Os Sphenoides</i>, we may
  observe one or two small Holes thro' which (according to the Opinion of
  some Modern Anatomists) the <i>Lympha</i> contain'd in the <i>Glandula
  Pituitaria</i> is thrown <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>into the <i>Sinus</i> of the edge of the
  <i>Os Sphenoides</i>; nevertheless it is certain, that these Holes are
  fill'd only with Sanguinary Vessels, which carry and bring back the Blood
  of the Bones and Membranes, whereof those <i>Sinus's</i> are compos'd;
  besides that, these Holes are rarely found in adult Persons.</p>

  <p>Between the Spine of the <i>Coronal</i> Suture and the <i>Crista
  Galli</i>, is a Hole which serves as an Entrance for a <i>Ductus</i>,
  which sinks from the top to the bottom, the length of about two Hairs
  breadth in the thickness of the inner Table of the <i>Coronal</i>: The
  Root of the upper <i>Longitudinal Sinus</i> is strongly implanted in this
  Hole, which also affords a Passage to some Sanguinary Vessels appointed
  for the Nourishment of this inner Table.</p>

  <p>Many other small Holes are found in divers places of the <i>Basis</i>
  of the Skull; the chief whereof are those that are observ'd in the
  <i>Apophysis Petrosa</i>, and give Passage to a great number of Vessels
  that serve for the Nutriment of that part of the Temporal Bone which is
  call'd the <i>Tympanum</i>, or Drum: The other Holes are principally
  design'd for the Vessels that are serviceable in the nourishing of divers
  parts of the <i>Basis</i> of the Skull.</p>

  <p><i>After what manner is the opening of the Head or Skull
  perform'd?</i></p>

  <p>It is done by sawing it asunder round about and above the Ears; then
  it is taken off, after having before cut off the Hair, and made a Crucial
  Incision in the Skin from the fore-part to the hinder, and from one Ear
  to the other; as also after having <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>pull'd off and laid down
  the four Corners to the bottom.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Brain anatomiz'd?</i></p>

  <p>It is done by cutting it Superficially, and by Leaves, in order to
  discover by little and little the Ventricles, Vessels, and Nerves, with
  their Original Sources, &amp;c. Or else it is taken entire out of the
  Skull, (the Nerves having been before examin'd) and laid down; so that
  without cutting any thing, all the parts of the Brain may be set in their
  proper places, to find out those that are sought for.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XVI.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Straps, Swathing-Bands, Bandages,
and Bolsters.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Strap?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of Band commonly made use of for the Extension of the
  Members in the reducing of Fractures and Luxations; or else in binding
  Patients, when it is necessary to confine them, for the more secure
  performing of some painful Operation: These sorts of Ligatures have
  different Names, <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>according to their several Uses, and often
  bear that of their Inventer.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Matter whereof these Straps are compos'd?</i></p>

  <p>They may be of divers sorts, but are usually made of Silk, Wooll, or
  Leather.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Swathing-Band?</i></p>

  <p>It is a long and broad Band, that serves to wrap up and contain the
  Parts with the Surgeons Dressings or Preparatives.</p>

  <p><i>Of what Matter are these Swathing-Bands made?</i></p>

  <p>They are made at present of Linnen-Cloth but in the time of
  <i>Hippocrates</i>, were made of Leather or Woollen-Stuff.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Swathing-Bands are there in general?</i></p>

  <p>There are two sorts, <i>viz.</i> the Simple and Compound; the former
  are those that are smooth, having only two ends; and the other are those
  which are trimm'd with Wooll, Cotton, or Felt, or that have many Heads,
  that is to say, Ends, fasten'd or cut in divers places according as
  different Occasions require.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Conditions requisite in the Linen-Cloth, whereof the
  Swathing-Bands are made?</i></p>

  <p>It must be clean, and half worn out, not having any manner of Hem or
  Lift.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Names of the different Swathing-Bands?</i></p>

  <p>There are innumerable, but the greater part them take their
  Denominations from their Figure or Shape; as the Long, Streight,
  Triangular, and those which have many Heads, or are trimm'd. <!-- Page 95
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is A Bandage?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Application of a Swathing-Band to any Part.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Bandages are there?</i></p>

  <p>As many as there are different Parts to be bound; some of them being
  Simple, and others Compound: The former are those that are made with an
  uniform Band; as the Bandage call'd the <i>Truss</i>, and divers other
  sorts: The Compound are those that consist of many Bands set one upon
  another, or sew'd together; or else those that have many Heads. They have
  also particular Names taken from the Inventers of them, or from their
  Effect; as <i>Expulsive</i> Bandages to drive back, <i>Attractive</i> to
  draw forward, <i>Contentive</i> to contain, <i>Retentive</i> to restrain,
  <i>Divulsive</i> to remove, <i>Agglutinative</i> to rejoin, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>There are others whereto certain peculiar Names are appropriated; as
  <i>Bridles</i> for the lower Jaw, <i>Slings</i> for the Chin, the back
  part of the Head, Shoulder, and <i>Perinæum</i>; <i>Scapularies</i> for
  the Body, after the manner of the Scapularies of Monks; <i>Trusses</i>
  for Ruptures; <i>Stirrups</i> for the Ankle-Bones of the Feet, in letting
  Blood, and upon other Occasions. Lastly, there are an infinite Number of
  Bandages, the Structure whereof is learnt by Practice, in observing the
  Methods of able Surgeons, who invent them daily, according to their
  several Manners; and the first <i>Ideas</i> of these can only be taken in
  reading Authors that have treated of them.</p>

  <p><i>What are the general Conditions to be observ'd in the Bandages?</i>
  <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span></p>

  <p>There are many, <i>viz.</i> 1. Care must be taken that the Bands be
  roll'd firm, and that they be not too streight nor too loose. 2. They are
  to be untied from time to time in Fractures, they must also be taken away
  every three or four Days, to be refitted. 3. They must be neatly and
  conveniently roll'd, that the Patient may not be uneasie or
  disquieted.</p>

  <p><i>What ought to be observ'd in fitting the Bolsters?</i></p>

  <p>Care must be taken to make them even, soft, and proportionable to the
  bigness of the Part affected; to trimm them most in the uneven places,
  that the Bands may be better roll'd over them, and to keep them
  continually moisten'd with some Liquor proper for the Disease as well as
  the Bands.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>In treating of every Disease in particular, we shall shew the
  manner of making the particular Bandage that is convenient for
  it.</i></p>

<h3><i>Of Tumours in general, Abcesses or Impostumes,
Breakings out, Pustules,
and Tubercles.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Tumour?</i></p>

  <p>A Tumour is a rising or bloated Swelling rais'd in some part of the
  Body by a Setling of Humours.</p>

  <p><i>How is this setling of Humours produc'd?</i></p>

  <p>Two several ways, <i>viz.</i> by <i>Fluxion</i> and
  <i>Congestion</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Setling by Fluxion?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which raiseth the Tumour all at once, or in a very little
  space of time, by the Fluidity of the Matter. <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is the Setling by Congestion?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which produceth the Tumour by little and little, and almost
  insensibly, by reason of the slow Progress and thickness of the
  Matter.</p>

  <p><i>Which are the most dangerous Tumours, those that arise from
  Fluxion, or those that derive their Original from Congestion?</i></p>

  <p>They that proceed from Congestion, because their thick and gross
  Matter always renders 'em obstinate, and difficult to be cur'd.</p>

  <p><i>Whence do the differences of Tumours proceed?</i></p>

  <p>They are taken, <i>first</i>, from the Natural Humours, <i>Simple</i>,
  <i>Mixt</i>, and <i>Alter'd</i>: <i>Simple</i>, as the <i>Phlegmon</i>,
  which is made of Blood, and the <i>Erysipelas</i> of Choler; <i>Mixt</i>,
  as the <i>Erysipelas Phlegmon</i>, which consists of Blood mingl'd with a
  Portion of Choler; or the <i>Phlegmonous Erysipelas</i>, which proceeds
  from Choler intermixt with a Portion of Blood: <i>Alter'd</i>, as the
  <i>Melia</i> which is compos'd of many Humours, that can not be any
  longer distinguish'd by reason of their too great Alteration.
  <i>Secondly</i>, the difference of Tumours is taken from their likeness
  to some other thing, as the Carbuncle and the <i>Talpa</i>, the former
  resembling a burning Coal, and the other a Mole, according to the
  Etymology of their <i>Latin</i> Names. <i>Thirdly</i>, From the Parts
  where they are situated; as the Ophthalmy in the Eye and the Quinsey in
  the Throat. <i>Fourthly</i>, from Disease that causeth 'em, as Venereal
  and Pestilential Buboes. <i>Fifthly</i>, from certain Qualities found in
  some, and not in others; as the <i>Encysted</i> Tumours, which have their
  Matter clos'd within their proper <i>Cystes</i> or Membranes, and so of
  many others. <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span></p>

  <p><i>How many kinds of Tumours are there that comprehend at once all the
  particular Species?</i></p>

  <p>They are four in Number, <i>viz.</i> the Natural Tumours, the
  Encysted, the Critical, and the Malignant.</p>

  <p><i>What are natural Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that are made of the four Humours contain'd in the Mass
  of the Blood, or else of many at once intermixt together.</p>

  <p><i>What are the four Humours contain'd in the Mass of the
  Blood?</i></p>

  <p>They are Blood, Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy, every one whereof
  produceth its particular Tumour: Thus the Blood produces the
  <i>Phlegmon</i>, Choler the <i>Erysipelas</i>, Phlegm the <i>Oedema</i>,
  and Melancholy the <i>Scirrhus.</i> The Mixture of these is in like
  manner the Cause of the <i>Erysipelatous Phlegmon</i>, the <i>Oedomatous
  Phlegmon</i> or <i>Phlegmonous Erysipelas</i>, and the <i>Phlegmonous
  Oedema</i>, according to the quality of the Humours which are
  predominant, from whence the several Tumours take their Names.</p>

  <p><i>What are the </i>Encysted<i> Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are those the Matter whereof is contain'd in certain
  <i>Cystes</i>, or Membranous Bags; as the <i>Meliceris</i>, and the
  <i>Struma</i> or Kings-Evil.</p>

  <p><i>What are Critical Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that appear all at once in acute Diseases, and
  terminate them with good or bad Success.</p>

  <p><i>What are Malignant Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that are always accompany'd with extraordinary and
  dreadful Symptoms, and whose Consequences are also very dangerous; as the
  Carbuncle in the Plague. <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span></p>

  <p><i>What are Impostumes or Abcesses, Breakings out and
  Pustules?</i></p>

  <p>Indeed, it may be affirm'd, that all these kinds of Tumours scarce
  differ one from another, except in their size or bigness; nevertheless,
  to speak properly, by the Names of Impostumes or Abcesses are understood
  gross Tumours that are suppurable, or may be dissolv'd, and by those of
  Breakings out and Pustules, only simple Pusteal Wheals, or small Tumours,
  that appear in great Numbers, and which frequently do not continue to
  Suppuration; some of them consisting of very few Humours, and others
  altogether of dry Matter.</p>

  <p><i>What difference is there between a Tumour and an Impostume or
  Abcess?</i></p>

  <p>They differ in this particular, that all Tumours are not Impostumes
  nor Abcesses; but there is no Impostume nor Abcess that is not a Tumour:
  As for Example, Wens and <i>Ganglions</i> are Tumours, yet are not
  Abcesses nor Impostumes; whereas these last are always Tumours in regard
  that they cause Bunches and Elevations.</p>

<h3><i>Of the general Method to be observ'd in
the curing of Tumours</i>.</h3>

  <p><i>What ought a Surgeon chiefly to observe in Tumours, before he
  undertake their Cure?</i></p>

  <p>He ought to know three things, <i>viz.</i> 1. The Nature or Quality of
  the Tumour. 2. The <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>time of its formation and 3. Its
  situation: The Quality of the Tumour is to be known, because the Natural
  one is otherwise handl'd than that which is Encysted, Critical or
  Malignant. As for the time of its Formation, it is four-fold, <i>viz.</i>
  the Beginning, Increase, State, and Declination, wherein altogether
  different Remedies are to be apply'd. The Situation of the Tumour must be
  also observ'd, because the dressing and opening of it ought to be as
  exact as is possible, to avoid the meeting with an Artery or neighbouring
  Tendon.</p>

  <p><i>How many ways are all the Tumours that are curable,
  terminated?</i></p>

  <p>They are terminated after two manners, <i>viz.</i> either by
  dissolving 'em, or by Suppuration.</p>

  <p><i>Are not the</i> Scirrhus <i>and the</i> Esthiomenus <i>or Gangrene,
  two means that sometimes serve to terminate and cure Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>Yes, but it is done imperfectly, in regard that a Tumour or Impostume
  cannot be said to be absolutely cur'd, as long as there remains any thing
  of the Original Malady, as it happens in the <i>Scirrhus</i>, where the
  Matter is harden'd by an imperfect dissolving of it, or when the
  Impostume degenerates into a greater and more dangerous Distemper, as it
  appears in the <i>Esthiomenus</i> or Gangrene that succeeds it.</p>

  <p><i>Which is the most effectual means of curing Impostumes, that of
  dissolving, or that of bringing them to Suppuration?</i></p>

  <p>That of dissolving 'em is without doubt the most successful, and that
  which ought to be us'd as much as is possible; nevertheless some Cases
  are to be excepted, wherein the Tumours <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>or Abcesses are
  Critical and Malignant; for then the way of Suppuration is not only
  preferable, but must also be procur'd by all sorts of means, even by
  opening; which may be done upon this occasion, without waiting for their
  perfect Maturity.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Precautions whereto a Surgeon ought to have regard
  before he undertake the opening of Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>He must take care to avoid cutting the Fibres of the Muscles, and in
  great Abcesses, to cause all the corrupt Matter to be discharg'd at once,
  to prevent the Patient's falling into a Swoon.</p>

  <p><i>Ought the opening of Tumours always to be made longitudinally, and
  according to the direct Course of the Fibres?</i></p>

  <p>No, it is sometimes necessary to open 'em with a Crucial Incision,
  when they are large, or when a <i>Cystis</i> or Membranous Vehicle is to
  be extirpated.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Matter are there that issue forth in the
  Suppuration of Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>There are four sorts, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Pus</i>, <i>Ichor</i>,
  <i>Sanies</i>, and <i>Virus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is</i>Pus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a thick Matter, and white as Milk.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Ichor<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a thick Matter like the <i>Pus</i>, but of divers Colours.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Sanies<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a watery Matter that riseth up in Ulcers, almost after the same
  manner as the Sap in Trees.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Virus<i>?</i> <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span></p>

  <p>It is a kind of watry Matter, being whitish, yellowish, and greenish
  at the same time; which issueth out of Ulcers, very much stinking, and is
  endu'd with corrosive and malignant Qualities.</p>

  <p><i>How many general Causes are there of Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>There are three, <i>viz.</i> the Primitive, the Antecedent, and the
  Conjunct: The Primitive is that which gives occasion to the Tumours; as
  for Example, a Fall or a Blow receiv'd. The Antecedent is that which
  supplies it with Matter, such is the Mass of Blood that thickens and
  maintains the <i>Phlegmon</i>. Lastly, the Conjunct Cause is the
  overflowing Blood or Matter, which immediately forms the Tumor.</p>

  <p><i>What regard ought to be had to these three sorts of Causes in the
  Cure?</i></p>

  <p>The Primitive Cause may be prevented by avoiding the Falls, Blows, or
  other Hurts, and the Antecedent by diminishing the Plethory of the Blood,
  and cooling the whole Mass by Phlebotomy. The Conjunct Cause, which is
  the overflowing of the Blood, may be also remov'd in dispersing it by
  dissolving, or else in discharging it by Suppuration.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Crisis<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a sudden setling of Humours, which happens in Diseases, whereby
  they are usually terminated.</p>

  <p><i>How are these Critical Setlings effected?</i></p>

  <p>By the Strength of Nature, which either expels the peccant Humours
  thro' the Belly, or carries them to the Habitude of the Body; for in the
  former she causeth Fluxes of Humours, Urine and Blood; as in the other
  she excites Sweatings, Tumours, and even a Gangrene it self.</p>

  <p><i>In what Parts do the Critical Tumours usually arise?</i> <!-- Page
  104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span></p>

  <p>In the Glandules, which the Ancients call'd the <i>Emunctories</i> of
  the Brain, Heart, and Liver; for they gave the Name of Emunctories of the
  Brain to the thick Glandules which lie under the Ears, that of the
  Emunctories of the Heart to those that are under the Arm-Pits; and that
  of the Emunctories of the Liver to those under the Groin. Now Malignant
  Tumours may arise in all these parts, but the Venereal happen only in the
  Groin.</p>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Phlegmon<i> and its Dependancies.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Phlegmon<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a red Tumour occasion'd by the Blood diffus'd in some part,
  wherein it causeth extension, pain, and heat with beating.</p>

  <p><i>Are</i> Aneurisms <i>and</i> Varices, <i>which are Tumours, made by
  the Blood, to be reckon'd among the</i> Phlegmons?</p>

  <p>No, because the Blood that forms the <i>Aneurisms</i> and
  <i>Varices</i> is not extravasated nor accompany'd with Inflammation, but
  only a Tumour of Blood proceeding from the Dilatation of the Arteries and
  Veins. <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p><i>May </i>Echymoses<i> or Contusions consisting of extravasated
  Blood, be esteem'd as </i>Phlegmons<i>?</i></p>

  <p>By no means, in regard that it is not sufficient that the Blood be
  extravasated for the producing of a <i>Phlegmon</i>; it must also cause
  Pain, Heat, and a Beating, with Inflammation, which is not to be found in
  the <i>Echymoses</i>, except in great ones, after they have been
  neglected for a long time; where the corrupted Blood ought to be let out
  immediately, to prevent the Inflammation, overmuch Suppuration, and many
  other ill Consequences.</p>

  <p><i>Is the </i>Phlegmon<i> always compos'd of pure Blood?</i></p>

  <p>No, it may happen sometimes to partake of Choler, Phlegm, or
  Melancholy; on which account it is nam'd an <i>Erysipelatous</i>,
  <i>Oedomatous</i>, or <i>Scirrhous Phlegmon</i>, always retaining the
  Name of the predominant Humour, which is the Blood; and so of the
  others.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for a </i>Phlegmon<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are of two sorts, <i>viz.</i> General and Particular; the former
  having regard to the antecedent cause, and the other to the conjunct. The
  <i>Phlegmon</i> is cur'd in its antecedent Cause, by Phlebotomy or
  letting Blood, by good Diet, and sometimes by Purgations, by which means
  the Plethory, Heat, and Alteration of the Blood is diminished; But
  Fomentations, Cataplasms and Plaisters facilitate the Cure in the
  conjunct cause, either by dissolving the Tumour, or bringing it to
  Suppuration. <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span></p>

  <p><i>At what time is the Opening of a Vein necessary?</i></p>

  <p>In the Beginning and Increase.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper to be us'd immediately upon the first
  appearing of the Tumour?</i></p>

  <p>They are Resolvents and Anodynes; such as those that are prepar'd with
  Chervil boil'd in Whey, adding a little Saffron to wash the Tumour, and
  soak the Linnen Cloaths apply'd thereto, which are often renew'd, and may
  be laid on with the Chervil.</p>

  <p>Or else take the Urine of a healthful Person, wherein is boil'd an
  Ounce of Saffron for a Glass, and bath the Tumour with it.</p>

  <p>The Sperm of Frogs is also made use of to very good purpose, either
  alone, or with Lime-Water and Soap mixt together; or Oak-Leaves and
  Plantane beaten small, and apply'd. But Care must be more especially
  taken to avoid cooling Medicines, Oils, and Grease, which are pernicious
  in great Inflammations.</p>

  <p><i>What ought to be done in the increase of the Tumour and
  Pain?</i></p>

  <p>They are to be asswag'd by mollifying and dissolving; to which end a
  Cataplasm or Pultis is to be made with the Leaves of Elder, Wall-wort or
  Dwarf-Elder, Mallows, Violet-Plants, Camomile, and Melilot; whereto is
  added beaten Line-seed; causing the whole Mass to be boil'd in Whey, and
  allowing to every Pint, or thereabout, a Yolk of an Egg, twenty Grains of
  Saffron, a quarter of a Pound of Honey, and the Crum of white Bread, till
  it comes to a necessary Consistence. Or else take Cow's Dung instead of
  the above-mention'd <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>Herbs, and mix with it all the other
  Ingredients, to make a Cataplasm, which must be renew'd at least every
  twelve Hours.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in the State?</i></p>

  <p>If the Tumour cannot be dissolv'd (as was intended) it must be brought
  to Suppuration by Cataplasms, consisting of these Ingredients,
  <i>viz.</i> Garlick, White Lillies roasted under Embers, Milk, and
  <i>Unguentum Basilicon</i>.</p>

  <p>Or else only take a Glass of Milk, in which an Ounce of Soap is
  dissolv'd, to wet the Linnen apply'd to the Tumour; and let it be often
  reiterated: Otherwise make use of Sorrel boil'd with fresh Butter, and a
  little Leaven or Yeast. The Plaister <i>Diasulphuris</i> is also most
  excellent either alone, or, if you please, mixt with <i>Diachylon</i> and
  <i>Basilicon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in the Declination after the
  Suppuration?</i></p>

  <p>The Ulcer must be at first gently dry'd with a Plaister of
  <i>Diasulphuris</i> or <i>Diachylon</i>, and afterward that of
  <i>Diapalma</i> may be us'd, and Ceruse or White Lead.</p>

  <p><i>What Method is to be observ'd in case there be any Disposition
  toward a Gangrene?</i></p>

  <p>It is requisite during the great Inflammation to make use of good
  Vinegar, in an Ounce whereof is dissolv'd a Dram of White Vitriol, with
  as much <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>, to bath the Tumour: Or else take the
  Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes, with a little <i>Unguentum Ægyptiacum</i>,
  and afterward make a Digestive of Turpentine, the Yolk of an Egg, and
  Honey, mingling it with a little Spirit of Wine, or Brandy, if there
  remains any Putrifaction or Rottenness. <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span></p>

  <p><i>Remedies for </i>Aneurisms<i> and </i>Varices<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in order to cure an </i>Aneurism<i>?</i></p>

  <p>When it is little, as that which happens after an Operation of
  Phlebotomy or letting Blood ill perform'd, it may be sufficient to lay
  upon the affected Part a thin Plate of Lead, or else a Piece of Money or
  Counter wrapt up in a Bolster, and to bind it on very streight: But a
  Piece of Paper chew'd is much better for that purpose.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Anuerism</i> be considerable, an Astringent Plaister may be
  us'd, such as the following.</p>

  <p>Take <i>Bolus</i>, Dragon's Blood, Frankincence, Aloes, and
  <i>Hypocystis</i>, of each a Dram; mingle the whole with two beaten Eggs,
  and add Wax to give it the consistence of a Plaister, which may be
  apply'd alone, or mixt with an equal Portion of <i>Emplastrum contra
  Rupturam</i>, always making a small Bandage to keep it on. <i>Emplastrum
  de Cicuta</i> hath also a wonderful effect.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Aneurism</i> is excessive, it is absolutely necessary to
  proceed to a Manual Operation, the manner whereof shall be shewn
  hereafter in the Treatise of great Operations.</p>

  <p><i>What is requisite to be done in the </i>Varices<i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>Varices</i> are not generally dangerous, but even conduce to the
  preservation of Health; nevertheless, if they become troublesome by
  reason of their greatness, and the Pains that accompanie 'em, they may be
  mollify'd with the following Remedy.</p>

  <p>Take the Mucilages of the Seeds of <i>Psyllium</i> and Line, of each
  two Ounces; of <i>Populeon</i> <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>two Ounces; <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i> &amp;
  <i>Hyperici</i>, of each one Ounce; and of the Meal of Wheat one Ounce,
  adding Wax to make the Consistence of a Plaister; part of which spread
  upon Linnen or Leather, must be apply'd to the <i>Varix</i>, and ty'd
  thereto with a small Band.</p>

  <p>If the Blood abound too much, it may be discharg'd by the Application
  of Leeches, or by a Puncture made with a Lancet: Afterward lay upon the
  Part a Piece of Lead sow'd up in a Cloth, and let it be kept close with a
  proper Bandage. Otherwise you may make use of an Astringent, such as
  this.</p>

  <p>Take a Pomegranate, cut it in pieces, and boil it with as much Salt as
  may be taken up with the Tip of your Fingers, in a Gallon of strong
  Vinegar; then dip a Spunge in this Vinegar, apply it to the <i>Varix</i>,
  bind it on, and continue the use of it twice a Day for a Month
  together.</p>

<h3><i>Remedies for </i>Echymoses<i>, Contusions, or Bruises.</i></h3>

  <p><i>How are </i>Echymoses<i> to be treated?</i></p>

  <p>All possible means must be us'd to dissolve 'em, by laying Slices of
  Beef upon the Part, renewing 'em very often, or applying Linnen Rags dipt
  in Spirit of Wine impregnated with Saffron.</p>

  <p>They may be also dissolv'd with the Roots of Briony grated and apply'd
  thereto, or else with Plaister or Mortar, Soot, Oil of Olives and
  <i>Unguentum Divinum</i>, a Mixture whereof being made, is to be put
  between two Rags, and laid upon the Tumour or Swelling. <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span></p>

  <p>If the <i>Echymosis</i> happens in a Nervous Part, Balsam of
  <i>Peru</i> may be us'd, or, for want thereof, <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i>
  &amp; <i>Hyperici</i>, with luke-warm Wine, with which the Bolsters must
  be soak'd, to be laid upon it.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Echymosis</i> is great, and much Blood is diffus'd between
  the Skin and the Flesh, the safest way is to make an Opening to let it
  out, lest a too plentiful and dangerous Suppuration should ensue, or even
  a Gangrene it self. However, a Surgeon ought to proceed in the curing of
  an <i>Echymosis</i> in the Face with great Circumspection, which must be
  always prepar'd for Incision.</p>

<h3><i>Of phlegmonous Tumors or Impostumes, and of
Remedies proper for 'em.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Tumours or Impostumes that partake of a
  </i>Phlegmon<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Bubo</i>, Carbuncle, <i>Anthrax</i>,
  <i>Furunculus</i>, <i>Phyma</i>, <i>Phygeton</i>, <i>Panaritium</i> or
  <i>Paronychia</i>, Burn, Gangrene, and Kibe or Chilblain.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Bubo<i>?</i></p>

  <p>A <i>Bubo</i> is a Tumour which ariseth in the Groin, being
  accompany'd with Heat, Pain, Hardness, and sometimes a Feaver.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Carbuncle?</i></p>

  <p>A Carbuncle is a hard Swelling, red, burning, and inseparable from a
  Fever: It is cover'd with a black Crust or Scab, that afterward falls off
  at the Suppuration, leaving a deep and dangerous Ulcer, and which
  sometimes doth not suppurate at all. <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is an </i>Anthrax<i>?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Anthrax</i> is very near the same thing as the Carbuncle, only
  with this difference, that the latter always appears in the Glandulous
  Parts, and the <i>Anthrax</i> every where else.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Furunculus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of Boil, or benign Carbuncle, which somewhat resembles
  the Head of a Nail, and is on that Account call'd <i>Clou</i> by the
  <i>French</i>, causing Pains, as if a Nail were driven into the
  Flesh.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Phygeton<i>?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Phygeton</i> is a small, red, and inflam'd Exuberance, situated
  in the Miliary Glandules of the Skin, where it causeth a pricking Pain,
  without Suppuration.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Phyma<i>?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Phyma</i> appears after the same manner as the <i>Phygeton</i>,
  and suppurates.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for all these sorts of phlegmonous
  Tumours and Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>They are Cataplasms and Plaisters Anodyn, Emollient, Resolvent, and
  Suppurative, which are us'd proportionably as in the
  <i>Phlegmons</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Gangrene<i>, </i>Sphacelus<i>, or
  </i>Esthiomenus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Gangrene</i> and <i>Sphacelus</i> signifie the same thing,
  nevertheless are commonly distinguish'd; the former being a Mortification
  begun, and the <i>Sphacelus</i> an entire or perfect Mortification;
  call'd also <i>Necrosis</i> and <i>Sideratio</i>. An <i>Esthiomenus</i>
  is a Disposition to Mortification, discover'd by the softness of the
  Part; and a Gangrene is defin'd to be a Mortification of a Part,
  occasion'd by the <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>Interception of the Spirits, and the
  Privation of the Natural Heat.</p>

  <p><i>What are the causes of a Gangrene in general?</i></p>

  <p>Every thing that can hinder the Natural Heat from exerting it self in
  a Part; as strong Ligatures, astringent or resolvent Medicines, not
  conveniently us'd in great Inflammations; a violent Hæmorrhage; or Old
  Age, whereby the Spirits are exhausted; the bitings of Mad Dogs;
  excessive Cold, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>By what Signs is the Gangrene known?</i></p>

  <p>It is discover'd by the livid Colour of the Skin, which departs from
  the Flesh, the softness, coldness, and insensibility of the Part; and
  sometimes by its dryness and blackness, from whence exhales a cadaverous
  Stench, with <i>Sanies</i> issuing forth after Punctures or
  Scarifications made therein. Lastly, a Gangrene is perceiv'd by the cold
  Sweats, Swoonings, <i>Syncope's</i>, and <i>Delirium's</i> that invade
  the Patient, and which are all the Fore-runners of approaching Death.</p>

  <p><i>Is a Gangrene only found in the Flesh, and soft Parts of the
  Body?</i></p>

  <p>It happens also in the Bones; and is then call'd <i>Caries</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How is this </i>Caries<i> or Gangrene of the Bone discover'd, when
  it lies hid under the Flesh?</i></p>

  <p>It is known by the black Colour of the Neighbouring Flesh, the Stink
  of the <i>Sanies</i> that comes forth, the intolerable Pains felt
  thereabouts, which are fix'd and continual before the Impostume and Ulcer
  appear; but when the Ulcer is made, a kind of roughness may be perceiv'd
  in the Bone. <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>R<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>M<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>D<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>I<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>S.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for a Gangrene?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that take away the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'morrify'd'.">mortify'd</span> and corrupt Parts,
  and recall the Natural Heat; both which Indications are exactly answer'd
  in the Extirpation of what is already corrupted, with the Incision-Knife;
  and the Restauration of the Natural Heat by the following Remedies.</p>

  <p>Take an Ounce of good Vinegar, steeping therein a Dram of White
  Vitriol, with as much <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>: Let it be us'd in bathing the
  Part; and apply thereto Bolsters well soak'd in the same Liquor. This
  Remedy is convenient in the first Disposition toward a Gangrene: Or, if
  you please, you may make use of the Yellow Water, which is made with
  Corrosive Sublimate and Lime-Water; taking, for Example, half a Dram of
  Corrosive Sublimate to be infus'd in a Pint of Lime-Water.</p>

  <p>But a Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes is more efficacious, wherein
  <i>Unguentum Ægyptiacum</i> is steep'd; or else Lime-Water kept for that
  purpose, in which have been boil'd two Ounces of Sulphur or Brimstone,
  with two Drams of <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>; adding four Ounces of Spirit
  of Wine, to make an excellent <i>Phegedænick</i> Water, with which the
  Part may be bathed, and the Bolsters soak'd.</p>

  <p>If the Gangrene passeth to the Bone, the Ulcer must be immediately
  cleans'd with Brandy, and <i>Euphorbium</i> afterward put into it, laying
  also some upon the Bolsters, and <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>abstaining from all
  sorts of Oils and Greases. But if these Remedies prove unprofitable,
  recourse is then to be had to the Incision-Knife, Fire, or Amputation;
  the manner of performing which several Operations, is explain'd
  hereafter.</p>

  <p><i>What are Kibes or Chilblains?</i></p>

  <p>They are painful Tumours, which are often accompany'd with
  Inflammation; they happen more especially in the nervous and outward
  Parts, as the Heel, and are so much the more sensibly felt, as the Air
  and Cold are more sharp and Vehement.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in order to cure these Kibes or
  Chilblains?</i></p>

  <p>The Heel or affected Part must be wash'd and dipt in Wine boil'd with
  Allum and Salt, whereof a Cataplasm may be afterward made, by adding Meal
  of Rye, Honey, and Brimstone. The Juice of a hot Turnep apply'd with
  <i>Unguentum Rosatum</i>, is also very good, or <i>Petroleum</i>
  alone.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Panaritium<i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>Panaritium</i> or <i>Paronychia</i>, is a Tumour which generally
  ariseth in the Extremity of the Fingers, at the Root of the Nails: It is
  red, and accompany'd with very great Pain, even so exquisite, that the
  whole Arm is sensible thereof, insomuch that a Fever sometimes ensues,
  and a Gangrene; the Humour being contain'd between the Bone and the
  <i>Periosteum</i>, or that little Membrane with which it is immediately
  invested.</p>

  <p><i>What Remedies are convenient for the curing of
  </i>Panaritium<i>?</i> <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span></p>

  <p>Anodyn Cataplasms are to be first apply'd, that is to say, such as
  serve to asswage excessive Pain, as that which is compos'd of Millk,
  Line-seeds beaten, large Figs, the Yolk of an Egg, Saffron, Honey and
  <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i>, with the Crum of white Bread. Afterward you may
  endeavour to dissolve it, by applying Oil of Almonds, <i>Saccharum
  Saturni</i>, and Ear-Wax, or else Balsam of Sulphur. The Plaister of
  Mucilages, and that of Sulphur or Brimstone, dissolv'd in Wine, is also a
  most excellent Resolvent and Anodyn.</p>

  <p>If it be requisite to bring this Tumour to Suppuration, white Lillies
  roasted under Embers may be added to the preceeding Cataplasm; or else a
  new Cataplasm may be made with Sorrel boil'd, fresh Butter, and a little
  Leaven.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Burn</i>?</p>

  <p>A burn is an Impression of Fire made upon a Part, wherein remains a
  great deal of Heat, with Blisters full of serous Particles, or Scabs,
  accordingly as the Fire hath taken more or less effect.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for a Burn</i>?</p>

  <p>A Burn is cur'd by the speedy Application of fresh Mud re-iterated
  many times successively; by that of peel'd Onions, <i>Unguentum
  Rosatum</i>, and <i>Populeon</i>, mixt with the Yolk of an Egg and
  unslack'd-Lime: Cray-Fishes or Crabs pounded alive in a Leaden-Mortar;
  and a great Number of other things.</p>

  <p>If the Burn be in the Face, you may more especially take the Mucilages
  of the Seeds of Quinces and <i>Psyllium</i>, and Frog's-Sperm, of <!--
  Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>each
  an equal quantity, adding to every four Ounces twenty Grains of
  <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>. This Composition may be spread on the Part with
  a Feather, and cover'd with fine Brown Paper. It is an admirable and
  approved Receipt.</p>

  <p>If the Burn hath made an Escar or Crust, it may be remov'd with fresh
  Butter spread upon a Colewort or Cabbage Leaf, and apply'd hot. But in
  Case the Scab is too hard, and doth not fall off, it must be open'd, to
  give passage to the <i>Pus</i> or corrupt Matter, the stay of which would
  occasion a deep Ulcer underneath. The same Method is to be observ'd in
  the Pustules or Blisters, two Days after they are rais'd, applying also
  the Ointment of quick Lime, Oil of Roses, and Yolks of Eggs.</p>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Erysipelas<i> and its Dependances.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is an </i>Erysipelas<i>?</i></p>

  <p>An <i>Erysipelas</i>, commonly call'd <i>St. Anthony's Fire</i>, is a
  small Elevation produc'd by a Flux of Choler dispers'd and running
  between the Skin and the Flesh. It is known by its yellowish Colour,
  great Heat and Prickings.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for an </i>Erysipelas<i>?</i></p>

  <p>An <i>Erysipelas</i> that ariseth in the Head and Breast is not
  without danger, and the Cure of <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>it ought to be undertaken with great Care
  in the Application as well of internal as external Remedies: For it is
  requisite to take inwardly a Dose of the Diaphoretick Mineral,
  Crabs-Eyes, Egg-shels, Powder of Vipers, and other Medicines; as also
  Potions that have the like Virtues, such as the following. Take four
  Ounces of Elder-Flower-Water, adding thereto a Scruple of the volatile
  Salt of Vipers or Hart's-Horn with an Ounce of Syrrup of red Poppies.</p>

  <p>Phlebotomy or Blood-letting hath no place here, unless there be a
  great Plethory, but frequent Clysters are not to be rejected, <i>viz.</i>
  such as are made of Whay, Chervil, Succory, and Violet-Plants, adding a
  Dram of Mineral Crystal dissolv'd with two Ounce of Honey of Violets.</p>

  <p>As for outward Applications, Linnen-Rags dipt in the Spirit of Wine
  impregnated with Camphire and Saffron, are to be laid upon the Tumour,
  and renew'd as fast as they are dry'd. An equal quantity of Chalk and
  Myrrh beaten to Powder, may also be strew'd upon a Sheet of Cap-Paper
  over-spread with Honey, and apply'd to the Part.</p>

  <p>If the Heat and Pain grow excessive, take half a Dram of <i>Saccharum
  Saturni</i>, twenty Grains of Camphire, as much <i>Opium</i>, with two
  Drams of red Myrrh, to be infus'd in a Gallon of White-Wine: Let this
  Liquor be kept to soak the Cloaths that are laid upon the
  <i>Erysipelas</i>, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'ond'."
  >and</span> often renew'd. But to dress the Face, a Canvass Cloth may be
  us'd, which hath been dipt in a Medicine prepar'd with a <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>Gallon of
  Whey, two Yolks of Eggs, and a Dram of Saffron.</p>

  <p>Moreover amidst all these Remedies, it is necessary to oblige the
  Patient to keep to a good Diet, and to prescribe for his ordinary Drink a
  Diet-Drink made of Hart's-Horn, the Tops of the lesser Centory, Pippins
  cut in Slices with their Skins, and Liquorish; a little good Wine may be
  also allow'd, with the Advice of the Physician.</p>

<h3><i>Of </i>Erysipelatous<i> Tumours or Impostumes, and
their Remedies.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Tumours or Impostumes that <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'parrake'.">partake</span> of the Nature of an
  </i>Erysipelas<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are the dry and moist <i>Herpes</i>, the former being that which
  is call'd the Tetter or Ring-Worm; and the other a kind of
  yellow-Bladders, Pustules, or Wheals, that cause itching, and raise small
  corroding Ulcers in the Skin: To these may be added divers sorts of Scabs
  and Itch.</p>

  <p>The Remedies prescrib'd for the <i>Erysipelas</i> may be us'd for both
  these kinds of <i>Herpes</i>; as also Lotions or Bathing-Liquors made of
  Lime-Water, and a Decoction of Wormwood and <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>,
  allowing half a Dram to four Ounces of Liquor. Or else take half a Dram
  of <i>Sal Saturni</i>, and put it into a Glass of the Decoction of
  Fumitory or Chervil. You may also make use of the Oil of Tartar <i>per
  deliquium</i>, to make a Liniment either alone, or mingl'd with the
  above-mention'd Decoctions.</p>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Oedema<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Oedema<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a white soft Tumour, with very little sense of Pain, which
  ariseth from the Settling of a pituitous Humour.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for an </i>Oedema<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are Fomentations, Cataplasms, Liniments, and Plaisters.</p>

  <p>The Fomentations are made with Bundles of Wall-Wort or Dwarf-Elder,
  thrown into a hot Oven after the Bread is bak'd, and sprinkled with Wine:
  Afterward being taken out smoaking, they are unty'd, open'd, and wrapt
  about the Part, putting a warm Linnen Cloth over 'em. This Operation is
  to be re-iterated; and by this means the Humour is dissolv'd thro'
  Transpiration by Sweat.</p>

  <p>The Cataplasms are compos'd of Camomile, Melilot, St.
  <i>John</i>'s-Wort, Sage, Wall-Wort, Pellitory of the Wall, Roots of
  Briony and Onions, all boil'd together in White Wine with Honey, adding,
  if you please, a few Cummin or Fennel Seeds beaten. Cataplasms are also
  made of Horse-Dung and the Seeds of Cummin beaten, which are boil'd in
  strong Vinegar, and mixt with Barly-Meal to the Consistence of Pap.</p>

  <p>The Plaisters are prepar'd with an Ounce of <i>Diapalma</i>, half on
  Ounce of <i>Martiatum</i>, a Pint of Oil of Lillies, half an Ounce of
  <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>Cummin-Seeds powder'd, half a Dram of
  <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>, and an Ounce of yellow Wax to make a
  Consistence.</p>

  <p>If any hardness remains, the Plaister of Mucilages may be apply'd, or
  that which is made of the Gums <i>Bdellium</i>, <i>Ammoniack</i>, and
  <i>Galbanum</i>, dissolv'd in Vinegar. But Care must be taken not to omit
  the Purgatives of Jalap to the quantity of a Dram in a Glass of
  White-Wine; or of half an Ounce of Lozenges of <i>Diacarthamum</i>, which
  are effectual in drawing out the bottom of pituitous and serous Humours
  that nourish the <i>Oedema's</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of </i>Oedomatous<i> Tumours and Impostumes.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the kinds of Tumours that partake of the Nature of an
  </i>Oedema<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Phlyctæna</i>, the <i>Emphysema</i>, the
  <i>Batrachos</i> or <i>Ranunculus</i>, the Wen, the <i>Talpa</i>, the
  <i>Bronchocele</i>, the <i>Ganglion</i>, the <i>Fungus</i>, the Scurf,
  the <i>Scrophula</i> or King's-Evil, and all sorts of Dropsies both
  general and particular.</p>

  <p><i>What are </i>Phlyctæna's<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are Pustules or Blisters fill'd with a white and somewhat
  yellowish Humour.</p>

  <p><i>What is an </i>Emphysema<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of flatuous Tumour, wherein Wind is contain'd, with a
  little slimy Phlegm.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Batrachos<i> or </i>Ranunculus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Blister fill'd with slimy Water, that ariseth under the Tongue
  near the String, and in <i>French</i> is call'd <i>Grenouillette</i>, or
  <i>the little Frog</i>; which is the same with its <i>Greek</i> and
  <i>Latin</i> Names. <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is a Wen?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Tumour consisting of thick plaistry Phlegm, which is reckon'd
  among the <i>Encysted</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Talpa<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a soft and very broad Tumour, which usually appears in the Head
  and Face, containing a white, thick and pituitous Matter.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Bronchocele<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a bunch'd Tumour which ariseth in the Throat, and causeth it to
  swell extremely; being compos'd of thick Phlegm mix'd with a little
  Blood, and ranked among the <i>Encysted</i> Tumours.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Ganglion<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a very hard Tumour, void of Pain and wavering, produc'd by thick
  Phlegm: But it is always found upon some Nerve or Tendon.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Fungus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a spungy Tumour that grows upon Tendons bruis'd or weaken'd by
  some Hurt.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Scurf?</i></p>

  <p>It is a whitish and scaly Tumour rais'd in the Skin of the Head by a
  viscous and mixt Phlegm, having its Root in the bottom of the Skin.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Scrophula<i> or King's-Evil?</i></p>

  <p><i>Scrophulæ</i> or <i>Strumæ</i>, commonly call'd <i>the
  King's-Evil</i>, are Tumours that generally shew themselves in the
  Glandules of the Neck, and in all those Parts where there are any. They
  consist of a viscous, serous, and malignant Phlegm, The Source or Root
  whereof is suppos'd to be in the Glandules of the Mesentery. They are
  also of the number of the <i>Encysted</i> Tumours. <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is the Dropsie?</i></p>

  <p>It is a soft Tumour occasion'd by the setling of abundance of serous
  Matter in the Parts where it appears.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Dropsies are there?</i></p>

  <p>There are three general <i>Species</i>, <i>viz.</i> the
  <i>Ascites</i>, <i>Tympanites</i>, and <i>Leucophlegmatia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is an Ascites?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of Dropsy that forms the Tumour or Swelling of the
  <i>Abdomen</i> or lower Belly, by a Mass of Water.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Tympanites<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of Dropsy, which in like manner causeth a Tumour or
  Swelling in the lower Belly, with this difference, that a great deal of
  Wind is mixt with the Water, which renders the Tumour transparent, and
  sounding, as it were a Drum; whence this Disease hath taken its Name.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Dropsy call'd </i>Leucophlegmatia<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Tumour, or, to speak more properly; a general Swelling or
  Bloating of all the other Parts of the Body, as well as of the lower
  Belly. It is produc'd by a viscous and mucilaginous sort of Phlegm;
  whence it happens that the Print of the Fingers remains in those places
  that have been press'd.</p>

  <p><i>What are the particular kinds of Dropsies?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that are incident to different Parts, of which they
  bear the Names; as the <i>Hydrocephalus</i>, which is the Dropsy of the
  Head; the <i>Exomphalus</i>, of the Navel, and the <i>Hydrocele</i> of
  the <i>Scrotum</i>. There is also a Dropsy of the Breast, and that of the
  <i>Matrix</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span></p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for all these sorts of Tumours or
  Dropsies?</i></p>

  <p>They are in general all those that are agreeable to the <i>Oedema</i>,
  which are variously us'd, as Liniments, Fomentations, Cataplasms, and
  Plaisters: Internal Medicines ought also to be much consider'd, as
  Diaphoreticks, Sudorificks, and Purgatives, when they are assisted by a
  regular Diet.</p>

  <p>A Decoction of the Roots of Briony with Cinnamon and Liquorish,
  provokes Urine very much; as well as a Decoction of Turneps and Carrets,
  and an Infusion of Sage in White-Wine.</p>

<h3><i>Of a </i>Scirrhus<i>, and its peculiar
Remedies.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Scirrhus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a hard unmoveable Tumour, almost altogether void of Pain, and of
  a livid dark Colour; which is form'd of a Melancholick Humour, frequently
  succeeding <i>Phlegmons</i> and <i>Oedema's</i> that have not been well
  dress'd with convenient Remedies.</p>

  <p><i>How is a </i>Scirrhus<i> cur'd?</i></p>

  <p>By mollifying or dissolving it, and seldom by bringing it to
  Suppuration.</p>

  <p>It may be mollify'd by the application of a Cataplasm or Pultis,
  compos'd of the Leaves of Violet-Plants, Mallows, Beets, Elder, Rue, and
  Wormwood, with Camomile-Flowers, <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>Horse-Dung, Cow-Dung,
  and White Lillies. The whole Mass is to be boil'd together in Wine,
  afterward adding Honey and Hogs-Lard, to make a Cataplasm thereof with
  the Crum of White Bread.</p>

  <p>It is dissolv'd with Plaisters compos'd of those of <i>Diachylon</i>,
  Melilot, and Mucilages, to which is added <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i>, and
  Flower of Brimstone. To render the Remedy more effectual, Oil of Tobacco
  may be also mixt with it, and Gum <i>Ammoniack</i> dissolv'd in
  Vinegar.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, these Topical or outward Medicines are to be accompany'd
  with others taken inwardly, which serve to prepare the Humours for
  convenient Evacuations; Such are Crab's-Eyes, the Decoctions of
  <i>Sarsaparilla</i>, the use of good Wine, and light Meats of easie
  Digestion.</p>

<h3><i>Of </i>Scirrhous<i> Tumours, and their Remedies.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Tumours that partake of the Nature of a
  </i>Scirrhus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Polypus</i>, <i>Carcinoma</i>, <i>Sarcoma</i>,
  <i>Natta</i>, and <i>Cancer</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Polypus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is an Excrescence of fungous Flesh arising in the Nostrils: But
  <i>Hippocrates</i> confounds the <i>Carcinoma</i> and <i>Sarcoma</i> with
  the <i>Polypus</i>, of which he says they are only a <i>Species</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is the </i>Natta<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Tumour or Excrescence of Flesh that appears in the Buttocks,
  Shoulders, Thighs, Face, and every where else, the various Figures <!--
  Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>of
  which cause it to be call'd by different Names. For one while it
  resembleth a Gooseberry, at another time a Mulberry, and at another time
  a Melon or Cherry. Sometimes also these Swellings are like Trees, Fishes,
  Birds, or other sorts of Animals, according to the ardent desire that
  Women with Child have had for things that they cou'd not obtain when they
  longed for 'em.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for the </i>Polypus<i>, and other
  kinds of Excrescences of the like Nature?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Polypus</i> may be cur'd in the beginning, but it is to be
  fear'd lest it degenerate into an incurable Cancer, when it hath been
  neglected or ill dress'd.</p>

  <p>Besides the general Remedies, which are letting Blood a little, and
  reiterated Purgations, with an exact Regulation of Diet, there are also
  particular Medicaments which dry up and insensibly consume the
  Excrescence; as a Decoction of Bistort, Plantain, and Pomegranate-Rinds
  in Claret-Wine, which is to be snuff'd up the Nose many times in a Day,
  and serves to soak the small Tents that are put up therein, as also often
  to cool the Part, adding a little Allum and Honey.</p>

  <p>The Patient must sometimes likewise keep in his Mouth a Sage-Leaf,
  sometimes a piece of the Root of Pellitory of <i>Spain</i>; and at
  another time Tobacco or some other thing of this Nature, which causeth
  Salivation. If the Tumour continues too long, and doth not yield to the
  above-mention'd Remedies, it is necessary to proceed to a Manual
  Operation, <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>which is very often perform'd with good
  Success.</p>

  <p>As for the <i>Natta's</i>, it is most expedient not to meddle with 'em
  at all; nevertheless these Marks which Infants bring along with 'em into
  the World, are frequently defac'd by an Application of the After-Burdens,
  whilst they are as yet warm, as soon as their Mothers are deliver'd.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Cancer?</i></p>

  <p>It is a hard, painful, and ulcerous Tumour, produc'd by an adult
  Humour, the Malignity whereof can scarce be suppress'd by any
  Remedies.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Cancers are there?</i></p>

  <p>There are two kinds, <i>viz.</i> The Primitive and the Degenerate; the
  Primitive Cancer is that which comes of it self, and appears at first
  about the bigness of a Pea or Bean, which nevertheless doth not cease to
  cause an inward Pain, continual, and pricking by intervals; during this
  time it is call'd an Occult Cancer; but when grown bigger, and open'd, it
  bears the Name of an Ulcerated Cancer; which is so much the less capable
  of being cur'd or asswag'd, as it makes it self more conspicuous by its
  dreadful Symptoms, or concomitant Circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Degenerate Cancer is that which succeeds an obstinate and
  ill-dress'd Tumour or Impostume, and which becomes an Ulcerated Cancer,
  without assuming the Nature of a blind or occult one.</p>

  <p><i>What Remedies are requisite to be apply'd to a blind Cancer?</i>
  <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span></p>

  <p>In regard that it cannot be known in this Condition without
  difficulty, it is often neglected; nevertheless it is a Matter of great
  Moment to prevent its Consequences, more especially by a good Diet, and
  by general Remedies, which may gently rectifie the intemperature of the
  Bowels: Afterwards Baths may be prescrib'd, together with the use of Whey
  Asses-Milk, and Specificks in general, as Powders of Crab's Eyes, Vipers,
  Adders, and others. As for Topical Remedies, none are to be administer'd,
  except it be judg'd convenient to apply to the Tumour a Piece of Lead
  rubb'd with Quick-silver; all others serving only to make the Skin
  tender, and apt to break. The Patient may also take for his Drink Water
  of <i>Scorzonera</i> and Hart's-Horn, with the Flowers of Bugloss or
  Borage, and Liquorice: Or else Quick-silver-Water alone, boiling an Ounce
  of it in a Quart of Water every time, the Quick-silver always remaining
  at the bottom of the Vessel.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies for an ulcerated Cancer?</i></p>

  <p>Besides the general ones, that are the same with those of the blind
  Cancer, there are also Topical, which may take place here. The Powders of
  Toads, Moles, Frogs, and Crabs calcin'd, cleanse the Ulcers perfectly
  well. A Decoction of Vipers and Crabs may serve to bath 'em, and some of
  it may be taken inwardly. Detersives made of Lime-Water, or Whey
  clarify'd, and boil'd with Chervil are very good; and (if you please) you
  may add Camphire or <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>. <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <p>If the Pains grow violent, recourse is to be had to <i>Laudanum</i>,
  one or two Grains whereof may be given in a little Conserve of Roses.
  When the Cancer is situated in the Glandules or Flesh, the Extirpation of
  it may also be undertaken with good Success.</p>

  <p>As for the manner of handling Degenerate Cancers, respect must be
  always had to the kind of Tumour, from whence it deriv'd its
  Original.</p>

<h3><i>Of Bastard or </i>Encysted<i> Tumours.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is an </i>Encysted<i> or Bastard Tumour or Impostume?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which is made of a Setling of mixt and corrupt Humours, the
  Matter whereof is contain'd in certain proper <i>Cystes</i> or Membranous
  Bags.</p>

  <p><i>What are the kinds of these Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Steatoma</i>, the <i>Atheroma</i>, the
  <i>Meliceris</i>, the Wen, the <i>Bronchocele</i>, and the
  <i>Scrophula</i> or King's-Evil.</p>

  <p><i>How is the difference between these Tumours discern'd?</i></p>

  <p>The <i>Steatoma</i> is known by its Matter resembling Suet; as that of
  the <i>Atheroma</i> resembleth Pap; and that of the <i>Meliceris</i> is
  like Honey: These three Tumours cannot be well distinguish'd on the
  outside, in regard that they do not change the natural Colour of the
  Skin, which <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>equally retains in all three the print of
  the Fingers that press it. But the <i>Bronchocele</i> is discover'd by
  the Place and Part which it possesseth; that is to say, the Throat; as
  also by its somewhat hard consistence without the Alteration of the Skin.
  The <i>Scrophulæ</i> or King's-Evil Swellings are known by their unequal
  Hardness, and their situation in the Glandules, either in the Neck,
  Arm-pits or elsewhere, without alteration likewise of the Skin.</p>

  <p><i>Want is the Method to be observ'd in curing these sorts of
  Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>An Attempt is to be made to dissolve 'em, as in all the others;
  nevertheless the safest way is to bring 'em to Suppuration, and to
  extirpate the <i>Cystes</i>, which are apt to be fill'd again after the
  Dissipation of the Humour.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Medicines proper to dissolve these Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>They are all such as may be us'd for the <i>Oedema</i> and
  <i>Scirrhus</i>; but the Specificks or particular Remedies are these:</p>

  <p>Take Rosemary, Sage, Wormwood, Elder, great Celandine, Camomile,
  Melilot, St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, and Tobacco; boil 'em in White-Wine with
  Soot and Mercurial Honey, adding, thereto Cummin-seeds beaten, and
  <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i>, to make a Cataplasm, which is to be renew'd
  twice a Day. Afterward if the Tumour be not dispers'd, you may apply the
  following Plaister, which hath an admirable Effect. <!-- Page 130
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span></p>

  <p>Take an equal Portion of the Plaister of <i>Diachylon</i>,
  <i>Devigo</i>, and four times as much <i>Mercury</i>, and <i>Emplastrum
  Divinum</i>; let 'em be dissolv'd together; then intermix Saffron, and
  Oil of Tobacco, to make a Plaister with the whole Mass, which may be
  spread upon thin Leather, and apply'd to the Tumour, without taking it
  off only once every eighth Day, to cool it; so that it must be laid on
  again after having wash'd and bath'd the Part with warm Urine or
  Brine.</p>

  <p>But it is to be always remember'd that external Remedies take effect
  only imperfectly, unless they are assisted by internal, such as in this
  case are <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'reirerated'."
  >reiterated</span> Purgations, join'd with a regular Diet.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper to excite Suppuration?</i></p>

  <p>To this purpose those may be us'd that serve in other kinds of
  Tumours: But as for the extirpation of the <i>Cystis</i>, it is done by
  dividing the Tumour into four Parts, by procuring Suppuration, and by
  consuming the Bag by little and little. The <i>Bronchocele</i> alone will
  not admit this Extirpation, by reason of the great Number of Nerves,
  Veins, and neighbouring Arteries amidst which the Tumour is settl'd.
  However <i>Bronchotomy</i>, or opening the Throat, may be perform'd;
  which is an Operation peculiar to this Tumour.</p>

<h3><i>Of Critical, Malignant, Pestilential, and
Venereal Tumours and Impostumes.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What difference is there between Critical, Malignant, Pestilential,
  and Venereal Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>It consists in these particular circumstances, <i>viz.</i> that
  Critical Tumours or Impostumes are indifferently all such as are form'd
  at the End or Termination of Diseases, in whatsoever Place or Part they
  appear.</p>

  <p>Malignant Impostumes or Tumours are those that are obstinate, and do
  not easily yield to the most efficacious Remedies.</p>

  <p>Pestilential Impostumes or Tumours are those that are accompany'd with
  a Fever, Swooning, Head-ach, and Faintness: They usually arise in the
  time of a Plague or Pestilence, and are contagious.</p>

  <p>Venereal Tumours or Impostumes are those that appear only at the
  bottom of the Groin, and are the product of an impure <i>Coitus</i>.</p>

  <p>However, the Critical Impostume may be Malignant, Pestilential, and
  Venereal; the Malignant Impostume may be neither Critical, nor
  Pestilential, nor Venereal: But the Pestilential and Venereal Tumours are
  always Malignant. <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span></p>

  <p><i>What are the ordinary kinds of Critical Tumours or
  Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Anthrax</i>, the Boil, the <i>Phlegmon</i>, and the
  <i>Parotides</i> or Swellings in the Almonds of the Ears.</p>

  <p><i>What are the kinds of Malignant Tumours or Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>They are the <i>Cancer</i>, the <i>Scrophula</i> or King's-Evil; and
  others of the like Nature.</p>

  <p><i>What are the kinds of Pestilential Tumours or Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>They are Carbuncles that break out every where; a sort of
  <i>Anthrax</i> which appears under the Arm-pits, and Bubo's in the
  Groin.</p>

  <p><i>What are the kinds of Venereal Tumours or Impostumes?</i></p>

  <p>They are Botches or Bubo's and Cancers that arise in the Yard; as also
  Wens and <i>Condyloma's</i> in the Fundament.</p>

  <p><i>What is the difference between a Pestilential and a Venereal
  Buboe?</i></p>

  <p>They may be distinguish'd by their Situation, and respective
  Accidents; the Pestilential lying higher, and the Venereal lower:
  Besides, a Fever, Sickness at the Heart, and an universal Faintness or
  Weakness, are the ordinary concomitant Circumstances of the former;
  whereas the Venereal Buboe is always the consequence of an impure
  <i>Coitus</i>, and is attended with no other Symptoms than those of
  common Tumours, <i>viz.</i> Pain, Heat, Shootings or Prickings,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>As for the Remedies, they may be sought for among those that have been
  already prescrib'd for Tumours.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Scurvy.</i></h3>

  <p>This Disease is known by the Ulcers of the Mouth, which are very
  stinking; as also by excessive Salivation, great Pains in the Head,
  Dizziness, frequent Epilepsies, Apoplexies, and Palsies. The Face, being
  of a pale red, and dark Colour, is sometimes puff'd up or bloated,
  inflam'd, and beset with Pustules: The Teeth are loose and ake, the Gums
  are swell'd, itch, putrifie, exulcerate, and are eaten with the Canker;
  and the Jaw is almost unmoveable: The Members are bow'd, and cannot be
  extended: The Patients become stupid and drowsie, so that they fetch
  their Breath with difficulty, are obnoxious to Palpitations of the Heart
  and Coughs, and fall into Swoons: The Ulcers sometimes are so malignant,
  that their Cheeks are entirely eaten up, and their Teeth seen: They are
  also much inclin'd to Vomitting, Looseness, and Gripes; and their
  Entrails are swell'd: They have red and livid Pustules on their Belly and
  Privy-parts, which sometimes break out into Ulcers; their whole Body
  being dry'd, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>This Disease may be easily cur'd in the beginning; but when it is
  grown inveterate, and invades the Bowels, it becomes incurable; as well
  as when it is the Epidemical Disease of <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>the Country, or the
  Persons afflicted with it, are old, or well advanc'd in Years.</p>

  <p>In undertaking the Cure, it is requisite to begin with a good Diet,
  and to sweeten the Blood, let the Patient take the Broth of boil'd Fowl;
  eating Pullets and Eggs; in the Broth may also be put divers sorts of
  Antiscorbutick Herbs; <i>viz.</i> Cresses, Spinage, Parsly-Roots,
  Sparagus, Smallage, <i>Scorzonera</i>, Scurvy-Grass, <i>&amp;c.</i> Let
  him eat nothing that is high season'd, nor acid or sharp; let him drink
  pure Claret, without any adulterate Mixture; let him use moderate
  Exercise and Rest; Lastly, let him keep his Mind sedate, and free from
  all manner of violent Passion.</p>

  <p>The following Remedies taken inwardly are very good for the Scurvy,
  <i>viz.</i> the Tincture of Flints from ten Grains to thirty;
  Diaphoretick Antimony, from six Grains to thirty; sweet Sublimate, from
  six Grains to thirty; <i>Mars Diaphoreteus</i>, from ten Grains to
  twenty; <i>Crocus Martis Aperitivus</i>, from ten Grains to two Scruples;
  prepar'd Coral, from ten Grains to one Dram; Volatile Spirit of <i>Sal
  Ammoniack</i>, from six Drops to twenty; Water of Cresses, from fifteen
  Drops to one Dram; Spirit of Scurvy-grass, from ten Drops to one Dram;
  Tincture of Antimony, from four Drops to twenty; Oily Volatile <i>Sal
  Ammoniack</i>, from four Grains to fifteen; Spirit of <i>Guyacum</i>,
  from half a Dram to a Dram and a half; Vitrioliz'd <i>Tartar</i>, from
  ten Grains to thirty; the Volatile Salt of <i>Tartar</i>, Urine, Vipers,
  and Hart's-Horn, of each from six Grains to fifteen; the Spirit of Gum
  <i>Ammoniack</i>, from eight Drops to sixteen; White <!-- Page 135
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span><i>Mercury</i>
  Precipitate, from four to ten Grains; <i>Mercurial Panacæa</i>, from six
  Grains to two Scruples. We shall shew the manner of compounding 'em in
  our Treatise of Venereal Diseases.</p>

  <p>It is also expedient to give Emollient and Detersive Clysters to the
  Patient at Night going to bed, his Body being always kept open with
  convenient Diet-drinks: Afterward let him take gentle Sudorificks, such
  as are made of the Decoctions of Fumitory, wild Cicory, Dandelion,
  Hart's-Tongue, Scabious, the lesser House-Leek, Germander, Borage,
  <i>Scorzonera</i>-Root, and Polypody, with Flowers of Broom, Elder, and
  Marygold.</p>

  <p>These are stronger for cold Constitutions, <i>viz.</i> Decoctions of
  Scurvy-Grass, <i>Lepidium</i>, Arse-smart, the lesser Celandine,
  Wormwood, little House-Leek, <i>Trifolium Febrinum</i>, Angelico,
  Juniper-Berries, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Convenient Decoctions to wash the Mouth may be made with Sage,
  Rosemary, Hyssop, Oak-Leaves, Scurvy-Grass, Cresses, Tobacco, Roots of
  Bistort, <i>Aristolochy</i> or Birth-Wort, Tormentil, Flower-de-Luce,
  <i>Balaustia</i> or Pomegranate-Flowers, Red Roses, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>To corroborate the Gums, Gargarisms are made of Anti-Scorbutick
  Plants; as of Spirit of Scurvy-Grass two Drams, one Scruple of Spirit of
  Vitriol, one Scruple of common Salt, four Ounces of Rose-Water and
  Plantane-Water. But if the Gums are putrefy'd, they are to be rubb'd with
  Honey of Roses, and some Drops of Spirit of Salt.</p>

  <p>To asswage the Pains of the Members, Bathings and Fomentations are to
  be us'd; and a <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>{136}</span>Decoction of Saxifrage taken inwardly,
  with some Grains of <i>Laudanum</i> is good for that Purpose.</p>

  <p>To allay the Gripes, Clysters may be given with Whey, Sugar, Yolks of
  Eggs, Syrrop of Poppies, and Oils of Earth-Worms, Scurvy-Grass, Camomile,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Against the Scorbutick Dropsy, take the Essence of <i>Trifolium
  Febrinum</i> and Elicampane, from twenty four Drops to thirty, and
  continue the use thereof.</p>

  <p>Milk taken inwardly hinders Vomitting; and a Broth or Gelly of Crabs
  sweetens the Blood. The Looseness may be stopt with the Essence of
  Wormwood, and Spirit of <i>Mastick</i>; as also the Fever with Febrifuges
  and Anti-scorbuticks.</p>

  <p>The Spots may be fomented with Decoctions of Aromatick and
  Anti-Scorbutick Herbs and Nitre. For the Ulcers of the Legs, pulverize an
  equal quantity of <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>, <i>Crocus Martis</i>, Myrrh,
  and <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>, and lay it upon the Bolsters that are to be
  apply'd to the Sores.</p>

  <p>To mollifie the sharpness of Acid Humours, this is a good Remedy:
  Prepare half an Ounce of Spirit of Scurvy-Grass, two Drams of tartariz'd
  Spirit <i>Ammoniack</i>, a Dram of the Tincture of Worms. Take thrice a
  Day fifteen or twenty Drops of this Liquor, in a Decoction of the Tops of
  Firr.</p>

  <p>Against the Tubercles, take two Handfuls of the Flowers of Camomile
  and Elder, three Drams of Briony-Root, and an Handful of White-Bread
  Crum; Boil the whole Composition in Milk, and make Cataplasms thereof.
  <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>To mitigate the Pains in the Head, take twenty or thirty five Drops of
  the Tincture of Amber, in Anti-scorbutick Spirits or Waters.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of Respiration may be remov'd by a Medicinal
  Composition made of two Drams of an Anti-scorbutick Water, two Drams of
  the Essence of Elicampane, and half a Dram of the Spirit of Gum
  <i>Ammoniack</i>; take three or four Spoonfuls thereof several times in a
  Day.</p>

  <p>To prevent the putrefaction of the Gums, take one Dram of the Tincture
  of Gum <i>Lacca</i>, three Drams of the Spirit of Scurvy-Grass, with
  fifteen or twenty Drops of Oil of Tartar made <i>per Deliquium</i>, and
  rub the Gums with this Composition many times in a Day. Brandy in which
  Camphire is infus'd, or Spirit of Wine, is likewise a most excellent
  Remedy; as also all Lotions or Washes made with the Waters or Decoctions
  of Anti-scorbutick Plants.</p>

  <p>For Leanness, Goat's-Milk with the Spirit of Scurvy-Grass may be us'd,
  and other Waters drawn from Anti-scorbutick Plants. The Apozemes or
  Decoctions of Endive, Cicory, Sorrel, <i>Becabunga</i>, and Snail-Water,
  are in like manner very good for the same purpose.</p>

  <p>Ointment of <i>Styrax</i> is frequently us'd in the Hospital call'd
  <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> at <i>Paris</i>, and apply'd to Spots and callous
  Swellings that arise in the Legs.</p>

<h3><i>Of Sutures.</i></h3>

  <p>Sutures or Stitches are made only in recent, and as yet bleeding
  Wounds, when they cannot be re-united by Bandage, as are the transverse;
  provided there be no Contusion, nor loss of Substance, nor great
  Hæmorrhages, as also that the Wounds were not made by the biting of
  venomous Beasts, that there be no violent Inflammations, and that the
  Bones are not laid open; because generally 'tis necessary to cause 'em to
  be exfoliated; neither is this Operation to be perform'd in the Breast,
  by reason of its Motion.</p>

  <p>The Instruments proper for the making of Stitches, are streight and
  crooked Needles, <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>with waxed Thread; and these Sutures are
  of four sorts, <i>viz.</i> first the <i>Intermittent Stitch</i> for
  transverse Wounds; the second for the Hare-Lip; the third, commonly
  call'd the <i>Dry Stitch</i>, for superficial Wounds; and the fourth,
  term'd the <i>Glover's Stitch</i>.</p>

  <p>The Intermittent Stitch is that which is made at certain separated
  Points, according to the following manner: After having taken away all
  extraneous Bodies out of the Wound, let a Servant draw together its Sides
  or Lips; and let a Needle with waxed Thread be pass'd thro' the middle
  from the outside to the inside, several Points being made proportionably
  to its length. It is requisite to pierce a good way beyond the Edge of
  the Wound, and to penetrate to the bottom, lest any Blood shou'd remain
  in the Space, that might hinder the reuniting.</p>

  <p>If the Wound hath Corners, the Surgeon begins to sow there; and before
  the Knot is made, causeth the Lips of the Wound to be drawn exactly close
  one to another: The Knots must be begun with that in the middle, and a
  single one is first made on the side opposite to the running of the
  Matter; laying upon this Knot (if it be thought convenient) a small
  Bolster of waxed Linnen, on which is tied a Slip-Knot, to the end that it
  may be untied if any bad Accident should happen. If a Plaister be apply'd
  to the Wound after the Stitching, a small Bolster is to be laid over the
  Knots, to prevent their sticking to the Plaister. In case any
  Inflammation happens in the Wound, the Knots may be loosen'd and ty'd
  again when the Symptoms cease: But <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>if the Inflammation
  continue, the Threads are to be cut by passing a Probe underneath: When
  the Wound is clos'd, the Threads are cut in like manner with a Probe; and
  in drawing 'em out, a Finger must be laid near the Knot, lest the Wound
  should open again.</p>

  <p>To make the second sort of Stitch for the Hare-Lip, a small streight
  Needle is pass'd into the sides of the Wound, and the Thread is twisted
  round the Needle, by crossing it above at every Stitch.</p>

  <p>To form the <i>Dry Stitch</i> in very superficial Wounds, a piece of
  new Linnen-Cloth is to be taken, wherein are made Digitations, or many
  Corners; the Selvedge or Hem ought to be on the side of these Corners or
  Digitations; and a small Thread-Lace is ty'd to every one of 'em.
  Afterward this Cloth is dipt in strong Glue, and apply'd about a Finger's
  breadth from the Edges of the Wound; so that a piece thereof being stuck
  on each side, the Laces may be ty'd together, to cause the Lips of the
  Wound to meet.</p>

  <p>To make the <i>Glover's Stitch</i>, the Operator having drawn together
  the Lips of the Wound, holds 'em between two Fingers, passeth a Needle
  underneath 'em, and soweth 'em upward all along, after the manner of
  <i>Glovers</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAP II.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Wounds in general.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Wound?</i></p>

  <p>A Wound is a recent, violent, and bloody Rupture or Solution of the
  Natural Union of the soft Parts, made by a pricking, cutting, or bruising
  Instrument.</p>

  <p><i>What ought to be observ'd before all things in the curing of
  Wounds?</i></p>

  <p>It is requisite to take notice of their differences, as well as of the
  Instruments with which they were made; to the end that Consequences may
  be drawn from thence for the Application of proper Remedies.</p>

  <p><i>From whence arise the differences of Wounds, and which be
  they?</i></p>

  <p>They are taken either from their Figure or Situation: With regard to
  their Figure, they are call'd Long, Broad or Wide, Triangular Great,
  Little, Superficial, or Deep; and with respect to their Situation, they
  are term'd Simple, Complicated, Dangerous, or Mortal.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Simple and a Complicated Wound?</i></p>

  <p>A Simple Wound is that which only opens the Flesh, and hath no other
  concomitant Circumstances; but a Complicated Wound, on the contrary, is
  that which is attended with grievous Symptoms, as Hæmorrhages, Fractures
  of Bones, Dislocation, Lameness, and others of the like Nature. <!-- Page
  142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span></p>

  <p><i>What is a dangerous and mortal Wound?</i></p>

  <p>A dangerous Wound is that which is complicated the Accidents whereof
  are dreadful: As when an Artery is open'd or prick'd, when a Nerve or
  Tendon is cut, or when the Wound is near a Joynt and accompanied with a
  Dislocation or Fracture. A mortal Wound is that which must be inevitably
  follow'd by Death; as is that which is situated deep in a principal Part
  necessary for the Preservation of Life.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Parts wherein Wounds are mortal?</i></p>

  <p>They are the Brain, the Heart, the Lungs, the <i>Oesophagus</i> or
  Gullet, the Diaphragm, the Liver, the Stomach, the Spleen, the small
  Guts, the Bladder, the Womb, and generally all the great Vessels.</p>

  <p><i>Wherein doth the Cure of Wounds consist?</i></p>

  <p>In helping Nature readily to procure the reuniting of the Parts that
  have been divided, after having taken away or asswag'd every thing that
  might cause an Obstacle.</p>

  <p><i>What are the things that hinder the speedy reunion of the
  Parts?</i></p>

  <p>They are extraneous Bodies found therein, as Bullets, Flocks, and
  Pieces of Wood or Stone, &amp;c. As also sometimes the Accidents which
  attend 'em; as an <i>Hæmorrhage</i> or Flux of Blood, Inflammation,
  <i>Esthiomenus</i> or Mortification, <i>Hypersarcosis</i>, or an
  Excrescence of Flesh, Dislocation, the Fracture of a Bone, the Splinter
  of a Bone, &amp; sometimes a contrary Air. <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

<h3><i>R<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>M<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>D<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>I<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>E<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>S.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper for stopping an </i>Hæmorrhage<i> or
  Flux of Blood?</i></p>

  <p>The common Remedy is a kind of Cataplasm, made up with the Powders of
  Aloes, Dragons-Blood, Bole Armenick and Whites of Eggs, which are mix'd
  together and laid upon the Wound. But the following is an excellent
  one.</p>

  <p>Take two Ounces of Vinegar, a Dram of <i>Colcothar</i>, two Drams of
  <i>Crocus Martis Astringens</i>; beat the whole together, steeping
  <i>Muscus Quercinus</i> therein; then throw upon it the Powder of
  Mushrooms, or of <i>Crepitus Lupi</i>: Apply this Remedy, and you'll soon
  stop the <i>Hæmorrhage</i>, taking Care nevertheless to bind the Part
  well, otherwise the Astringents do not readily take Effect.</p>

  <p>To this Purpose you may also make use of Cobwebs, Mill-Dust, and the
  Powder of Worm-eaten Oak; or else take Oven-Soot mixt with the Juice of
  the Dung of an Ass or Ox, adding only thereto the White of an Egg.</p>

  <p>Besides these Remedies there are also actual and potential Cauteries,
  or simple Ligatures, which are infallible. Indeed the actual Cautery is
  not always sure; because when the Escar made by the Fire, falls off the
  Hæmorrhage breaks out again as before: but the potential Cautery is
  almost always successful; such as the following.</p>

  <p>Take about an equal Quantity of Vitriol and Powder of Mushrooms; apply
  'em upon a little Lint to the Place where the Blood issueth <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>forth, and
  you'll see it stop immediately: But Care must be taken to avoid touching
  a Nerve or Tendon; by reason that the Vitriol is apt to excite
  Convulsions.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Inflammation and Mortification of a Wound
  Suppress'd?</i></p>

  <p>If the Inflammation proceeds from the Presence of an Extraneous Body,
  it must be taken away as soon as possible with a Pair of Forceps, and if
  from the Quantity of <i>Pus</i> or corrupt Matter, it must be let out.
  But in case the Inflammation ariseth from extreme Pains, they are to be
  asswaged with Cataplasms or Pultises and anodyn Liniments, such as those
  that have been already prescribed in the Cure of the <i>Phlegmon</i>: or
  else the Part may be bath'd with Camphirated Spirit of Wine, mixt with as
  much Water: <i>Saccharum Saturni</i> infus'd in Lime-water, performs the
  same Effect, and the Water of Crabs alone is admirable in its
  Operation.</p>

  <p>Against the <i>Esthiomenus</i> or Mortification, make use of Wine
  boil'd with Wormwood, St. <i>John</i>'s Wort, Rosemary and Aloes; or else
  take the Tincture of Aloes and Myrrh, or Spirit of Wine alone impregnated
  with Camphire and Saffron.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in Case a Convulsion happens by reason of a
  wounded Nerve or Tendon?</i></p>

  <p>If the Convulsion be caus'd by the Presence of an Extraneous Body that
  bruiseth the Part it must be taken away; and if from the wounding of a
  Nerve, pour into the Wound some Drops of the Oil of Lavender distill'd,
  which in that Case is of singular Use; this Oyl may be also taken
  inwardly in an appropriated Liquour, such as a <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>{145}</span>Decoction of Wormwood
  and the Tops of the lesser Centory. Balsam of <i>Peru</i> us'd in the
  same Manner, is an excellent Remedy, and the Oyls of Worms, Snails, St.
  <i>John</i>'s-Wort and Turpentine are frequently apply'd with good
  Success.</p>

  <p>If the Convulsion proceeds from the Biting of some venomous Creature,
  Cupping-Glasses or Leeches are to be immediately applied, putting into
  the Wound Treacle with the Spirit of Wine or even Fire it self, and
  leaving to the Physician's Care the Prescription of other vulnerary
  Remedies proper to be taken inwardly.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done to draw the Extraneous Bodies out of a
  Wound?</i></p>

  <p>When they cannot be taken away with the Fingers or Forceps, the
  Patient must be set in the same Station or Posture wherein he was when he
  receiv'd the Wound, in order to get some farther Light to discover 'em;
  or else such Plaisters may be us'd as are endu'd with an Attractive
  Quality: Particularly this:</p>

  <p>Take an Ounce of Treacle, half a Dram of Gum <i>Ammoniack</i>, one
  Dram of <i>Bdellium</i>, and two Drams of Bore's Grease, adding a Quarter
  of a Pound of Wax to make 'em up into the Form of a Plaister. It is
  reported that Hare's Grease alone hath the same Effect, and that it goes
  for a Secret among the Surgeons but you may (if you please) mix it with
  Ointment of Betony. However it hath been observed that Leaden Bullets may
  sometimes remain in a Man's Body, during his whole Life-time without
  doing any Harm. <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span></p>

  <p><i>How are Excrescences to be taken away?</i></p>

  <p>They may be consum'd with Powder of Allom, <i>Unguentum
  Ægyptiacum</i>, or <i>Lapis infernalis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>After having remov'd every thing that hinders the reuniting of the
  Lips of a Wound, what is to be done to attain thereto?</i></p>

  <p>The Re-Union in Wounds is properly the Work of Nature; but it may be
  promoted by putting into 'em a little Balsam of <i>Peru</i>, and drawing
  together their Lips with the Fingers. Afterwards the Lips must be kept
  closed with a Bandage, a Glutinous Plaister or a dry Stitch, provided the
  Wound be only superficial, hindring the Air from penetrating into it. For
  Want of Balsam of <i>Peru</i>, an excellent one may be made with the
  Flowers here specified.</p>

  <p>Take the Flowers of Henbane, St. <i>John's-Wort</i>, and Comfry and
  let 'em be digested in the Sun during the whole Summer-Season in the Oyl
  of <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Hmp-seed'."
  >Hemp-seed</span>, which Oyl, the longer it is kept, proves so much the
  better, if it be set forth in the Sun every Summer, the Vessel that
  contains it being well stop'd. There is also the Balsam of Balsams, or
  the Balsam of <i>Paracelsus</i> call'd <i>Samech</i>.</p>

  <p>To avoid the exposing of Wounds to the Air, it is requisite to cover
  'em over the Dressings with some sort of Plaister, which is usually
  termed the Surgeon's Plaister, such is that which is effectual in
  Dissolving, corroborating and allaying Pain or Inflammation.</p>

  <p>Take the Mucilages of the Roots of great Comfrey and Fenegreek, half a
  Pound of Ceruse or white Lead, two Drams of Crude <i>Opium</i>, one Dram
  of Camphire, as much of Saffron, two Drams of Sandarack, one of the Oyl
  of <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>Bays, one half Pound of Rosin, and as much
  Turpentine and Wax. Boil all these Ingredients together in a sufficient
  Quantity of Lin-seed-Oyl, and make a Plaister according to Art.</p>

  <p>In great Wounds it is expedient to lay over the Dressings a Cataplasm
  or Pultiss, such as this:</p>

  <p>Take the Leaves and Flowers of Camomile, and Melilot, the Tops of
  Wormwood, common Mallows and Marsh-Mallows, with the Seeds of Line and
  Cummin powder'd: Then boyl the whole Composition in Wine, and add thereto
  Barly-Meal, to give it a due Consistence. If there be any Cause to fear a
  Gangrene, you may also intermix Saffron, Myrrh and Aloes with Spirit of
  Wine.</p>

  <p><i>Is it necessary to put Tents into all Wounds, and to make use of
  Digestives and Suppuratives?</i></p>

  <p>No: It is sufficient to procure the Re-uniting of the Parts simply by
  the Means of Balsam in small Wounds; because they ought not to be brought
  to Suppuration: so that Digestives and Suppuratives are only necessary in
  great Wounds, and those that are accompanied with Contusion, avoiding the
  ill Custom of some Country-Surgeons, that stuff up their Wounds too much
  with Tents and Pledgets, whereas they might well be content with simple
  Bolsters or Dossels which shou'd be dipt in the ordinary Digestive
  composed of Turpentine and the Yolks of Eggs with a little Brandy, or
  else with the Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes.</p>

  <p>Suppuration may also be promoted by mundifying and quickening the
  Wound, especially if the Bolsters be steep'd in the following
  Composition. <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span></p>

  <p>Take half an Ounce of Aloes and Myrrh powder'd, two Drams of <i>Sal
  Saturni</i>, twenty Grains of <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>, the same quantity of
  beaten Cloves, a Dram of Queen of <i>Hungary</i> Water and half an Ounce
  of <i>Unguentum Basilicon</i>, and let the whole Mass be mingled
  together.</p>

  <p>In fine, the whole Mystery consists in well cleansing the Wounds with
  a Linnen Cloth, or with the Injections of the Tinctures of Myrrh and
  Aloes; or with simple Decoctions of Wormwood, <i>Scordium</i> or
  Water-Germander, Bugle, Sanicle and Hore-Hound in White-Wine; as also by
  prescribing the Vulnerary Decoctions of Powder of Crab's-Eyes, and
  <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>, to be taken inwardly, to consume the acid
  Humours, which are a very great Obstacle that hinders the speedy cure of
  Wounds.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Vulnerary Plants, the Decoctions of which is to be
  taken inwardly?</i></p>

  <p>They are <i>Alchymilla</i> or Lion's-Foot, Ground-Ivy, <i>Veronica</i>
  or Fluellin, St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, Wormwood, Centory, Bugle, Sanicle,
  Chervil, and others. The Broth of Crabs may also be prescrib'd, which is
  an excellent Remedy, and may serve instead of a Vulnerary Potion.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Sutures or Stitches contribute very much to the re-uniting
  of the Lips of Wounds, when they cannot be join'd by Bandage.</p>

<h3><i>Of particular Wounds of the Head.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What ought first to be consider'd in a Wound of the Head?</i></p>

  <p>Two things, that is to say, the Wound it self, and the Instrument with
  which it was made; for by the Consideration of the Wound, we may know
  whether it be Superficial or Deep; and by that of the Instrument, we are
  enabled to make a truer Judgment concerning the Nature of the same
  Wound.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Superficial, and what is a Deep Wound in the
  Head?</i></p>

  <p>That is call'd a Superficial Wound in the Head, which lies only in the
  Skin; and that a Deep one which reacheth to the <i>Pericranium</i>,
  Skull, or Substance of the Brain.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be apply'd to a Superficial Wound?</i></p>

  <p>It is cur'd with a little Queen of <i>Hungary</i> Water; or else with
  a little Balsam, laying upon it the Surgeon's Plaister, or that of
  Betony. But if the Wound or Rent be somewhat large, it must be clos'd
  with a Stitch.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done to a Deep Wound?</i></p>

  <p>If it be situated in the <i>Pericranium</i>, the Wound must be kept
  open, waiting for Suppuration; but if it enter the Skull, an Enquiry is
  to be made, whether there be a Simple Contusion, or a Fracture also. In
  the Contusion it is necessary to wait for the Suppuration, and the <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span>fall
  of the Splint, and to keep the Wound open; as in the Fracture, to examine
  whether it be in the first Table only, or in both; it is known to be only
  in the first, by the Application of an Instrument, and of Ink, as also in
  regard that there are no ill Symptoms; but a Fracture in both Tables
  shews it self by the Signs; and it may be found out by making a Crucial
  Incision in the Flesh, to discover the Fissure.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Signs of the Fracture of the two Tables of the Skull,
  and of the overflowing of the Blood upon the Membranes of the
  Brain?</i></p>

  <p>They are the loss of the Understanding at the very Moment of receiving
  the Wound; an Hæmorrhage or Flux of Blood thro' the Nose, Mouth, or Ears;
  drowsiness and heaviness of the Head, and more especially Vomitting of
  Phlegm; from whence may be inferr'd the necessity of making use of the
  Trepan.</p>

  <p><i>What Consequence may be drawn from the Knowledge of the Instrument
  with which the Wound was made?</i></p>

  <p>It is according to the Quality of this Instrument; as it is proper to
  cut, prick, or bruise; if it be cutting, the Wound is more Superficial,
  and not subject to a great Suppuration: If it be pricking, the Wound is
  deeper, but of small Moment: If it be a battering or bruising Instrument,
  the Wound is accompany'd with Contusion, producing a great Suppuration,
  besides the Concussion and Commotion of the Part, which are inseparable,
  and often cause very dangerous Symptoms. <!-- Page 151 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>{151}</span></p>

  <p>Inferences may be made also from the disposition of the wounded
  Person; for a strong robust Man may better bear the Stroke than a weak
  one; and even Anger causeth an Augmentation of Vehemency; so that all
  such Circumstances are not to be despis'd, in regard that they give
  occasion to profitable Conjectures.</p>

  <p><i>What particular Circumstance is there to be observ'd in undertaking
  the Cure of Wounds in the Face?</i></p>

  <p>It is, that a more nice Circumspection is requir'd here than
  elsewhere, in abstaining from Incisions, as well as in making choice of
  proper Medicines, which must be free from noisome Smells; and it is in
  this Part chiefly that Balsams are to be used, avoiding Suppuration, to
  prevent Scars and other Deformities.</p>

<h3><i>Of the particular Wounds of the Breast.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is to be observ'd in Wounds of the Breast?</i></p>

  <p>Two things, <i>viz.</i> whether they penetrate into the Cavity of the
  <i>Thorax</i> or not, which may be discover'd by the Probe, and by a
  Wax-Candle lighted, and apply'd to the Entrance of the Wound, obliging
  the Patient to return to the same Posture wherein he receiv'd the Hurt,
  as also to keep his Nose and Mouth shut: For then the Flame may be
  perceiv'd to be wavering, the Orifice of the Opening being full of <!--
  Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>Bubbles; a Judgment may be also made from
  the running out of the Blood.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done when it is certainly known that the Wound
  penetrates into the Cavity of the Breast?</i></p>

  <p>It is necessary to examine what Part may be hurt, by considering the
  situation of the Wound, and its Symptoms: If the Lungs are pierc'd, a
  spitting of froathy Vermilion-colour'd Blood ensues, with difficulty of
  Respiration, and a Cough. If any of the great Vessels are open'd, the
  wounded Person feels a Weight at the bottom of his Breast, is seiz'd with
  cold Sweats, being scarce able to fetch his Breath, and Vomits Blood,
  some Portion whereof issueth out of the Wound. If the <i>Diaphragm</i> or
  Midriff be cut in its Tendinous Part, he is suddenly hurry'd into
  Convulsions: And if the Heart be wounded either in its <i>Basis</i> or
  Ventricles, he falls into a Swoon, and dies incontinently.</p>

  <p>But if the Probe doth not enter, and none of the above-mentiond
  Symptoms appear, it may be taken for granted that the Wound is of no
  great Consequence.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done when the Wound penetrates into the Chest, yet
  none of the Parts are hurt, only there is an Effusion of Blood over the
  </i>Diaphragm<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is necessary to make an <i>Empyema</i>, or otherwise the diffus'd
  Blood in corrupting, wou'd inevitably cause an Inflammation, Gangrene,
  and Death it self.</p>

  <p><i>What is an </i>Empyema<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is an Operation whereby any sorts of Matter are discharg'd with
  which the Diaphragm is over-spread, by making a Puncture or Opening in
  the Breast.</p>

<h3><i>Of the particular Wounds of the
lower Belly.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is to be done to know the quality of a Wound made in the lower
  Belly?</i></p>

  <p>It is requisite to make use of the Probe, to observe the situation of
  the Wound, and to take notice of all the Symptoms: For by the help of the
  Probe, one may discover whether it hath penetrated into the Cavity or
  not, after having enjoyn'd the Patient to betake himself to the same
  Posture wherein he was when he first receiv'd the Wound: By its situation
  a Conjecture may be made that such a particular Part may be hurt; and by
  a due Examination of the Symptoms, one may attain to an exact Knowledge.
  As for Example; It is known that one of the thick Guts is open'd, when
  the Hurt is found in the <i>Hypogastrium</i>, and the Excrements are
  voided at the Wound; as it is certain that one of the thin Guts is
  pierc'd, when the Wound appears in the Navel, and the Chyle issueth forth
  from thence; and so of the others.</p>

  <p><i>What Method ought to be observ'd in curing Wounds in the lower
  Belly?</i></p>

  <p>It is expedient at first to prevent letting in the Air, and to dilate
  the Wound, in order to sow up the perforated Gut, and afterward to <!--
  Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>restore it to its place; as also to bind
  the Caul, which is let out at the opening, and to cut it off, lest in
  putrifying it should corrupt the neighbouring Parts. Then these Parts may
  be bath'd with Lees of Wine, wherein have been boil'd the Flowers of
  Camomile and Roses with Wormwood: The Powders of Aloes, Myrrh, and
  Frankincense may be also thrown upon 'em; and the Wound must be sow'd up
  again to dress it on the outside, the Patient in the mean time being
  restrain'd to a regular Diet. But Clysters must be forborn on these
  Occasions, especially when one of the thick Guts is wounded, making use
  rather of a Suppository or laxative Diet-Drinks, to avoid dilation and
  straining.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="full" />

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> VI.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Wounds made by Guns or Fire-Arms.</i></h3>

  <p>These Wounds are always bruis'd and torn, with the loss of Substance,
  and commonly with the splitting and breaking of a Bone: They are red,
  black, livid, and inflam'd, not being usually accompany'd with an
  Hæmorrhage: They are generally round, and streighter at their Entrance
  than at their End; at least if they were not made with Cross-Bar-Shot, or
  Quarter-Pieces. <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Prognostick of Wounds by Gun-shot.</i></h3>

  <p>When these Wounds penetrate into the Substance of the Brain, or Marrow
  of the Back-Bone, or into the Heart, <i>Pericardium</i>, great Vessels,
  and other noble Parts, Death always inevitably follows, and often happens
  at the very Instant. But one may undertake the Cure of those that are
  superficial, and which are made in the Neck, Shoulders, Arms, and all
  other parts of the Body.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Cure of Wounds by Gun-shot.</i></h3>

  <p>For the better curing of these sorts of Wounds, it is requisite to be
  inform'd of the Quality of the Fire-Arms by which the Wounds were made,
  in regard that a Musquet is more dangerous than a Pistol, and a Cannon
  much more than a Musquet; as also to examine their situation and
  concomitant Accidents; for by how much the more complicated they are, so
  much the greater is the danger. Then the Patient must be set (as near as
  can be) in the very same Situation and Posture wherein he remain'd when
  the Wound was receiv'd, in order to discover the direct Passage of the
  Wound by the help of the Probe, with which a search is to be made,
  whether a Bullet, or any other extraneous Bodies, as Wood, Flocks,
  Linnen, or Stuff as yet stick in the Wound; so that Endeavours may be
  us'd to take 'em out thro' the same Hole where they enter'd, care being
  more especially had to avoid making <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>Dilacerations in
  drawing 'em out: But if the Operator hath endeavour'd to no purpose to
  remove these extraneous Bodies, let him make a Counter-Opening in the
  opposite Part, where he shall perceive any hardness, nevertheless without
  touching the Vessels; thus the Incision being made, he may readily draw
  'em out with his Fingers, or some other Instrument.</p>

  <p>If the Bullet sticks so far in a Bone that it cannot be taken away
  without breaking the same Bone, it is more expedient to let it lie
  therein; but if the Leg or Arm-Bones are very much split or shattered,
  then the Amputation of 'em becomes absolutely necessary. The Pain and
  Inflammation of the Part may be asswag'd by letting Blood, topical
  Anodyns, cooling Clysters and Purgations; but in case much Blood hath
  been already lost, Phlebotomy must be omitted. The Clysters may be made
  with Decoctions of Mercury, Mallows, Beets, a Handful of Barley and Honey
  of Roses.</p>

  <p>Some Surgeons are of Opinion that the Patient ought to be purg'd every
  other Day, and even on the very same Day that he receiv'd the Wound, if
  his Strength will permit; however very gentle Purges are to be us'd upon
  this occasion, such as Cassia, Manna, Tamarins, Syrrup of Violets, and
  that of White Roses.</p>

  <p>In the mean while Anodyns may be compounded to mitigate the Pain; as
  Cataplasms or Pultisses made with the Crum of white Bread, Milk, Saffron,
  the Yolk of an Egg, and Oil of Roses us'd hot; which last Ingredient is
  of it self a very good Anodyn. But to asswage great Inflammations, Oil of
  <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>Roses, the White of an Egg and Vinegar
  beaten all together, may be laid on the neighbouring Parts.</p>

  <p>At first it is necessary to apply spirituous Medicines to the Wound,
  and Pledgets steep'd in camphirated Brandy, are admirable for that
  purpose; but if there be a Flux of Blood, styptick Waters, or other
  astringent Remedies may be us'd, still remembring that all these
  Medicaments must be apply'd hot.</p>

  <p>To promote the Suppuration of these contused Wounds, a Digestive may
  be made of <i>Oleum Rosatum</i>, the Yolk of an Egg, and <i>Venice</i>
  Turpentine.</p>

  <p>If the Wound be in the Nerves, Tendons, or other Nervous Parts, it is
  requisite to use spirituous and drying Medicines, never applying any
  Ointments, which will not fail to cause Purtrefaction in those Parts: But
  a Cataplasm may be made with Barley-Meal, <i>Orobus</i>, Lupins and
  Lentils boil'd in Claret, adding some Oil of St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort.</p>

  <p>The Balsam of <i>Peru</i>, Oil of Turpentine destill'd, Oil of Wax,
  destill'd Oil of Lavender, <i>Oleum Philosophorum</i>, Oil of Bays
  destill'd, Balsam of St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, Spirit of Wine, and Gum
  <i>Elemi</i>, are excellent Medicaments for the Nerves: Or else,</p>

  <p>Take four Ounces of <i>Unguentum Althææ</i> with a Dram and a half of
  destill'd Bays; mingle the whole Composition, and apply it: Or else,</p>

  <p>Take an Ounce of destill'd Oil of Turpentine, a Dram of Spirit of
  Wine, and half an Ounce of Camphire; let all be intermixt, and dropt into
  the Wound: Or else, <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>Take a Scruple of <i>Euphorbium</i>, half an Ounce of
  <i>Colophonia</i>, and a little Wax; let 'em be mingl'd together, and
  apply'd very hot to the Nervous Parts.</p>

  <p>If the Wounds are deep, Injections may be made with this Vulnerary
  Water, which is very good for all sorts of Contusions, as also for the
  Gangrene and Ulcers.</p>

  <p>Take the lesser Sage, the greater Comfrey, and Mugwort, of each four
  Handfuls; Plantane, Tobacco, Meadowsweet, Betony, Agrimony, Vervein, St.
  <i>John</i>'s-Wort, and Wormwood, of each three Handfuls; Fennel,
  Pilewort Bugle, Sanicle, Mouse-Ear, the lesser Dazy, the lesser Centory,
  and All-heal, of each three Handfuls; three Ounces of round Birth-Wort,
  and two Ounces of long: Let the whole Composition be digested during
  thirty Hours, in two Gallons of good White-Wine, and afterward destill'd
  in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>, till one third part be consumed.</p>

  <p>If a Gangrene happens in the Part, Spirit of Mother-Wort may be put
  into it, which is compounded with two Drams of Mastick, Myrrh,
  <i>Olibanum</i>, and Amber, and a Quart of rectify'd Wine, the whole
  being destill'd.</p>

  <p>This Fomentation may be apply'd very hot to very good purpose,
  <i>viz.</i> an equal quantity of Camphirated Wine and Lime-Water, with
  three Drams of Camphire.</p>

  <p>This is also an excellent Cataplasm: Take a Pint of Lye, and as much
  Spirit of Wine, half an Handful of Rue, Sage, <i>Scordium</i>, and
  Wormwood, a Dram of each of the Roots of both sorts of Birth-Wort, and
  two Drams of <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span><i>Sal Ammoniack</i>. Let the whole
  Composition be boil'd till a third Part be consum'd; adding half a Dram
  of Myrrh and Aloes, and a little Brandy.</p>

<h3><i>Of a Burn made by Gun-Powder.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Burn be recent, and the Skin not exulcerated, Spirit of Wine or
  Brandy is to be immediately apply'd; or else an Ointment may be made with
  Oil of Olives, or bitter Almonds, Salt, the Juice of Onions, and
  Verjuice.</p>

  <p>If the Skin be ulcerated, and little Bladders or Pustules arise, an
  Ointment may be compounded with the second Bark of Elder boil'd in Oil of
  Olives. After it hath been strain'd, add two parts of Ceruse or
  White-Lead, and one of Burnt Lead, with as much Litharge, stirr'd about
  in a Leaden-Mortar, to make a Liniment. But it is not convenient to take
  out the Grains of Powder that remain in the Skin, because they are apt to
  break, and to be more confounded or spread abroad; so that they must be
  left to come forth in the Suppuration.</p>

  <p>When the Wound is superficial, and the Skin as yet whole, peel'd
  Onions with common Honey are an excellent Remedy; but if the Skin be
  torn, it is not to be us'd, by reason that the Pain wou'd be too great;
  in which case Oil of Tartar <i>per diliquium</i> hath a very good
  effect.</p>

  <p>If the Burn be accompany'd with a Fever, it may be allay'd with fixt
  Nitre, Nitre <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>prepar'd with Antimony, and Gun-Powder
  taken inwardly, which are very effectual in their Operation. Crab's-Eyes
  prepar'd, and even some of 'em unprepar'd, are in like manner admirable
  Remedies.</p>

  <p>As for external Medicaments, when the Burn is only superficial, take
  Onions and unslack'd Lime, quench'd in a Decoction of Rapes, and apply
  this Liquor very hot, with double Bolsters dipt therein. Or else take
  what quantity you please of quick Lime well wash'd, and pound it
  thoroughly in a Leaden-Mortar, with May-Butter without Salt, to make an
  Ointment, which may <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'be be'."
  >be</span> laid altogether liquid upon the affected Part: Or else,</p>

  <p>Take as much quick Lime as you can get up between your Fingers at two
  several times; Milk-Cream and clarify'd Honey, of each about half the
  like quantity; let the whole be intermix'd to the Consistence of an
  Ointment, and apply'd: It is an approv'd Remedy; as also is the
  following;</p>

  <p>Take unslack'd Lime, and put it into common Water, so as the Water may
  appear four or five Finger's breadth above it. After the Effervescence,
  pour in Oil of Roses; whereupon the whole Mass will be coagulated in form
  of Butter, and may be apply'd.</p>

  <p>A good Lotion or Washing-Liquor may be prepar'd with the Juice of
  Garlick and Onions, in recent Burns; otherwise make use of this Ointment.
  Take an Ounce and an half of raw Onions, Salt, and <i>Venice</i> Soap, of
  each half an Ounce; mingle the whole Composition in a Mortar, pouring
  upon it a sufficient <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>{161}</span>quantity of Oil of Roses, to make a very
  good Ointment: Or else,</p>

  <p>Dissolve <i>Minium</i> or Litharge in Vinegar, filtrate this Liquor,
  and add thereto a quantity of Rape-Oil newly drawn off, sufficient to
  give it the Consistence of a liquid Liniment; then stir it about in a
  Leaden-Mortar till it become of a grey Colour, and keep it for Use as an
  excellent Liniment: Or else,</p>

  <p>Pound Crey-Fishes or Crabs alive in a Mortar to get their Blood, and
  foment the Part with it hot; it is a good Remedy: Otherwise intermix the
  pounded Crabs with May-Butter without Salt, and let 'em be boil'd up
  together, and scumm'd, till a red Ointment be made, which may be drawn
  off, or strain'd for Use. And indeed, all manner of Ointments, and other
  Medicinal Compositions wherein Crabs are an Ingredient, are true
  specificks against Burns made by Gun-Powder.</p>

  <p>The Mucilages of the Seeds of <i>Psyllium</i>, or rather those of
  Quince-Seeds prepar'd with Frog's Sperm, and a little <i>Saccharum
  Saturni</i>, spread with a Feather upon the affected Part, have a
  wonderful Operation in Burns.</p>

  <p>A Medicament compounded with one third part of the Oil of Olives, and
  two of the Whites of Eggs well beaten and mixt together, is a very simple
  and singular Remedy. Otherwise take half an Ounce of Line-seed-Oil
  infus'd in Rose-Water, with four Yolks of Eggs; beat 'em together, and
  let the whole be apply'd to the burnt Part.</p>

  <p>If the Burn be very violent, and hath many Pustules, <i>Etmullerus</i>
  is of Opinion that they <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>ought to be open'd, and that an Ointment
  shou'd be apply'd, which is made of Hen's-Dung boil'd in fresh Butter:
  Otherwise,</p>

  <p>Take a handful of fresh Sage-Leaves, two handfuls of Plantane, six
  Ounces of fresh Butter without Salt, three Ounces of Pullet's-Dung newly
  voided, and the whitest that can be found; then fry the whole Composition
  for a quarter of an Hour; squeeze it out, and keep it for use:
  Otherwise,</p>

  <p>Take two Ounces of sweet Apples roasted under Embers, Barly-Meal, and
  Fenugreek, of each half an Ounce, and half a Scruple of Saffron; let the
  whole Mass be mingled to make a Liniment or soft Cataplasm, which may
  serve to asswage Pain, and mollifie the Skin.</p>

  <p>If the Wound be yet larger, and hath a Scab, open all the Pustules,
  and endeavour the two first Days to cause the Escar to fall off by the
  Application of a Liniment made of the Mucilages of Quince-Seeds steept in
  Frog's-Sperm, with fresh Butter, the Oil of White Lillies, and the Yolk
  of an Egg: Otherwise,</p>

  <p>Make a Liniment with fresh Butter well beaten in a Leaden-Mortar, with
  a Decoction of Mallows, which being spread upon hot Colewort-Leaves, and
  apply'd to the Escar, it will fall off.</p>

  <p>But if the Escar be too hard and obstinate, it is requisite to proceed
  to Incisions to make way for the <i>Sanies</i>, lest a deep and putrid
  Ulcer shou'd be engender'd Underneath. As soon as the Humour is
  evacuated, the above-mention'd <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page163"></a>{163}</span>Emollient Medicines may be us'd, till the
  separation of the Escar; then the Ulcer may be consolidated with
  Digestives and Mundificatives; such as the Ointment of quick Lime with
  Oil of Roses, and the Yolks of Eggs. The white camphirated Ointments, and
  that of Alabaster, are also good for the same Purpose.</p>

  <p>If a Gangrene ensueth, Sudorificks must be taken inwardly; such are
  camphirated Spirit of Treacle, the Essence and Spirit of Elder-Berries,
  the Spirit of Hart's-Horn with its own proper Salt, Treacle impregnated
  with the Spirit of camphirated Wine, Scorpion-Water, Hart's-Horn, Citron
  with Camphire, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>As for external Remedies in the beginning of the Gangrene, the Spirit
  of Wine apply'd hot is excellent; and yet better if Aloes, Frankincense,
  and Myrrh be intermixt therein. It ought also to be observ'd, that
  Camphire must always be mingled in the topical Medicines for the Cure of
  the Gangrene.</p>

  <p>A Decoction of unslack'd lime, in which Brimstone hath been boil'd,
  with <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>, and the Spirit of Wine, is a very
  efficacious Remedy.</p>

  <p>In a considerable Gangrene, after having made deep Scarifications, let
  Horse-Dung be boil'd in Wine, and laid upon the Part in form of a
  Cataplasm. This is an approved Remedy.</p>

  <p>If a <i>Sphacelus</i> be begun, scarifie the Part, and apply thereto
  abundance of <i>Unguentum Ægyptiacum</i> over and above the Ointments and
  Cataplasms already describ'd; remembring <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>always, that when the
  Gangrene degenerates into a <i>Sphacelus</i>, all the mortify'd Parts
  must be incontinently separated or cut off from the sound.</p>

<h3><i>Of Ulcers in general.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is an Ulcer?</i></p>

  <p>An Ulcer is a Rupture of the Natural Union of the Parts made a long
  while ago, which is maintain'd by the <i>Sanies</i> that runs out of its
  Cavity; or an Ulcer takes its Rise from a Wound that cou'd not be well
  cur'd in its proper time, by reason of the ill quality of its <i>Pus</i>
  or corrupt Matter.</p>

  <p><i>What difference is there between a Wound and an Ulcer?</i></p>

  <p>It is this, that a Wound always proceeds from an external Cause, and
  an Ulcer from an internal, such as Humours that fall upon a Part; or else
  a Wound in growing inveterate degenerates into an Ulcer.</p>

  <p><i>Whence is the difference of Ulcers deriv'd?</i></p>

  <p>It is taken from the Causes that produce 'em, and the Symptoms or
  Accidents with which they are accompany'd. Thus upon Account of their
  Causes they are call'd Benign or Malignant, Great, Little, Dangerous, or
  Mortal; and by reason of their Accidents, they are term'd Putrid,
  Corrosive, Cavernous, Fistulous, Cancerous, <i>&amp;c.</i> <!-- Page 165
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span></p>

  <p><i>Do Ulcers always proceed from external Causes, or from an outward
  Wound degenerated?</i></p>

  <p>No they sometimes also derive their Origine from internal Causes, as
  the Acrimony of Humours, or their Malignant Quality; the Retention of a
  Splint of a Bone, and other things of the like Nature. These Ulcers are
  commonly call'd Primitive, and the others Degenerate.</p>

  <p><i>What are Putrid, Corrosive, Cavernous, Fistulous and Cancerous
  Ulcers?</i></p>

  <p>The Putrid Ulcer is that wherein the Flesh is soft and scabby, the
  <i>Pus</i> and <i>Ichor</i> being viscous, stinking, and of a cadaverous
  smell.</p>

  <p>The Corrosive Ulcer is that which by the Acrimony and Malignity of its
  <i>Sanies</i>, corrodes, makes hollow, corrupts and mortifies the
  Flesh.</p>

  <p>The Cavernous Ulcer is that the Entrance of which is streight and the
  bottom broad wherein there are many Holes fill'd with malignant
  <i>Sanies</i>, without any callosity or hardness in its sides.</p>

  <p>The Fistulous Ulcer is that which hath long, streight, and deep Holes,
  with much hardness in its sides; the <i>Sanies</i> whereof is sometimes
  virulent, and sometimes not.</p>

  <p>The Cancerous Ulcer is large, having its Lips bloated, hard, and
  knotty, of a brown Colour, with thick Veins round about, full of a livid
  and blackish sort of Blood. In the bottom are divers round Cavities,
  which stink extremely, by reason of the ill Quality of the <i>Sanies</i>
  that runs out from thence.</p>

  <p><i>Are there no other kinds of Ulcers?</i> <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span></p>

  <p>Yes, there are also Verminous, <i>Chironian</i>, <i>Telephian</i>,
  Pocky, Scorbutick, and others, which have much affinity with, and may
  well be reckon'd among the five Kinds already specify'd.</p>

  <p><i>What are the means to be us'd in the curing of Ulcers?</i></p>

  <p>Ulcers ought to be well mundify'd, dry'd and cicatriz'd; but with
  respect to the several Causes and Accidents that render 'em obstinate,
  and difficult to be cur'd, it is also requisite to make use of internal
  Medicines, which may restrain and consume 'em. If their sides grow
  callous, they are to be scarify'd, in order to bring 'em to Suppuration;
  and if there be any Excrescences, they must be eaten away with corroding
  Powders, such as that of Allom; or by the Infernal Cautery.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Remedies proper to cleanse and dry up Ulcers?</i></p>

  <p>To this Purpose divers sorts of Liquors may be us'd, as also Powders
  and Plaisters: The Liquors are usually made of Briony-Roots, the greater
  Celandine, Lime, and Yellow Water; a Tincture of Myrrh, Aloes and
  Saffron, and Whey, whereto is added <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>; so that the
  Ulcers may be wash'd or bath'd with these Liquors; and very good
  Injections may be compounded of 'em.</p>

  <p>The Powders are those of Worm-eaten-Oak, Allom, and Cinoper, the last
  of these being us'd by burning it, to cause the Fume to be convey'd to
  the Ulcer thro' a Funnel. The Country People often make use of
  Potter's-Earth to dry up their Ulcers, with good <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span>Success; but then they
  must must be of a Malignant Nature.</p>

  <p>The Plaisters are <i>Emplastrum de Betonica</i>, <i>Diasulphuris</i>,
  <i>Dessiccativum Rubrum</i>, and others; and the Ointments are such as
  these;</p>

  <p>Take three Yolks of Egg, half an Ounce of Honey, and a Glass of Wine,
  and make thereof a mundifying Ointment, according to Art: Otherwise,</p>

  <p>Take Lime well wash'd and dry'd several times, let it be mingled with
  the Oil of Line and <i>Bolus</i>, and it will make an excellent Ointment
  to mundifie and dry; a little <i>Mercury Precipitate</i> may be intermixt
  (if you please) to augment the drying Quality; and <i>Mercurius
  Dulcis</i> may be added in the Injections.</p>

  <p>For Ulcers in the Legs, and Cancerous Ulcers, take Plantain-Water and
  Allom-Water, or else Spirit of Wine, <i>Unguentum Ægyptiacum</i>, and
  Treacle; or else an Extract of the Roots of round Birth-Wort made in the
  Spirit of Wine. Gun-Powder alone dissolv'd in Wine, is of singular Use to
  wash the Ulcers, and afterwards to wet the Pledgers which are to be
  apply'd to 'em. But here are two particular and specifick Medicines to
  mollifie a Cancer.</p>

  <p>Take <i>Saccharum Saturni</i>, Camphire, and Soot; let 'em be
  incorporated with the Juice of House-Leek and Plantain, in a
  Leaden-Mortar; then make a Liniment thereof, and cover the Part affected
  as lightly as is possible to be done, as with a simple Canvass-Cloth, or
  a Sheet of Cap-Paper: Or else, <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span></p>

  <p>Take the destill'd Water of rotten Apples, and mingle it with the
  Extract of the Roots of round Birth-Wort made in Spirit of Wine;
  reserving this Liquor to wash the Part, and to make Injections.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> VIII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Venereal Diseases.</i></h3>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Chaude-pisse<i> or </i>Gonorrhæa<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Signs of this Disease are a painful Distention of the <i>Penis</i>
  or Yard, and a scalding Pain in making Water, the Urine being pale,
  whitish, and full of Filaments or little Threads: Sometimes the Testicles
  are swell'd as well as the <i>Glans</i> and <i>Præputium</i>; and
  sometimes there is a Flux of a kind of Matter yellowish, Greenish,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>If there be a great Inflammation in the Yard, endeavours must be us'd
  to allay it by letting Blood; and afterward the Patient may take a
  cooling and diuretick Diet-Drink, as also Emulsions made with cold Seeds
  in Whey. A very good Decoction may be prepar'd in all places, and without
  any trouble, by putting a Dram of <i>Sal Prunella</i> into every Quart of
  Water, whereof the Patient is to drink as often as he can: This Decoction
  is very cooling and diuretick; and the use of it ought to be continu'd
  till the Inflammation be asswag'd. Then some gentle <!-- Page 169
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>Purges are to
  be prescrib'd in the beginning; such as an Ounce of <i>Cassia</i>, and as
  much <i>Manna</i>, infus'd in two Glasses of Whey, which are to be taken
  one or two Hours one after another.</p>

  <p>Afterward the Patient must be often purg'd with twelve Grains of
  Scammony, and fifteen Grains of <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>; and these
  Purgations must be continu'd, till it appears that the Fluxes are neither
  yellowish nor greenish, nor of any other bad Colour. When they are become
  White, and grown Thready, they may be stopt with Astringents: Amber and
  dry'd Bones beaten to Powder, eighteen Grains of each, with one Grain of
  <i>Laudanum</i>, the Composition being taken in Conserve of Roses, are
  very good for this Purpose. <i>Crocus Martis Astringens</i>, or else its
  Extract, taken from half a Dram to a whole Dram, in like manner performs
  the same Operation. As soon as the <i>Gonorrhæa</i> is stopt, to be
  certain of a perfect Cure, a Dram of the <i>Mercurial Panacæa</i> is to
  be taken, from fifteen to twenty Grains at a time, in Conserve of Roses.
  In the mean while, if a small Salivation shou'd happen, it must be let
  alone for the present, since it may be stopt at pleasure by the
  Purgations. When it is requisite to restrain the <i>Gonorrhæa</i>,
  <i>Mercury</i> must not be given any longer, in regard that it is a
  Dissolvent, which is only good when the Glandules of the Groin or
  Testicles are swell'd, or else when it is expedient to set the
  <i>Chaude-pisse</i> a running, after it hath been too suddenly stopt. At
  the same time that the Astringents are taken with the Mouth, <!-- Page
  170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>Injections
  also are to be made into the Yard; such as are prepar'd with <i>Lapis
  Medicamentosus</i>, of which one Dram is put into eight Ounces of
  Plantane-Water. All Astringents that are not Causticks, are proper for
  the Syringe.</p>

<h3><i>Of Shankers.</i></h3>

  <p>They are round Ulcers, and hollow in the middle, which appear upon the
  <i>Glans</i> and the <i>Præputium</i>. To cure 'em, they must be touch'd
  with the <i>Lapis Infernalis</i>, and brought to Suppuration by the means
  of red Precipitate mixt with the Ointment of <i>Andreas Crucius</i>.
  <i>Oleum Mercurii</i> laid on a Pledget or Bolster, is very efficacious
  to open Skankers, and consume their Flesh. The Patient must be well
  purg'd with <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i> and Scammony, taking twelve or
  fifteen Grains of each in Conserve of Roses; and after these Purgations
  are sufficiently reiterated, he may take the <i>Mercurial Panacæa's</i>.
  It is an excellent Remedy for all sorts of Pocky Distempers not yet
  consummated, or arriv'd at the greatest height of Malignity.</p>

<h3><i>Of </i>Bubo<i>'s.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Bubo's</i> are gross Tumours or Abcesses that arise in the Groin,
  the perfect Maturity of which is not to be waited for in order to open
  'em; because it is to be fear'd lest the corrupt Matter remaining therein
  too long, might be convey'd into the Blood by the Circulation, and so
  produce the grand Pox: Therefore it is <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>necessary to open 'em
  betimes with a Lancet, or else with a Train of potential Cauteries, if
  they are too hard. They ought to be Suppurated for a considerable time:
  The Patient must be well purg'd with Scammony and <i>Mercurius
  Dulcis</i>: He must also take the <i>Mercurial Panacæa's</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Pox.</i></h3>

  <p>This loathsome Disease begins sometimes with a virulent
  <i>Gonorrhæa</i>, and a weariness or faintness at the same time seizeth
  on all the Members of the Body: It is usually accompany'd with Salivation
  and the Head-ach, which grows more violent at Night: Pricking Pains are
  also felt in the Arms and Legs, the Palate of the Mouth being sometimes
  ulcerated. If it be an inveterate Pox, the Bones are corrupted, and
  <i>Exostoses</i> happen therein; divers Spots with dry, round and red
  Pustules appear in the Skin; and the Cartilages or Gristles of the Nose
  are sometimes eaten up. But when this Disease is come to its greatest
  height of Malignity, the Hair falls off; the Gums are ulcerated; the
  Teeth are loose, and drop out; the whole Body is dry'd up; the Eyes are
  livid; the Ears tingle; the Nose become stinking; the Almonds of the Ears
  swell; the <i>Uvula</i> or Palate is down; Ulcers break out in the
  Privy-Parts; Bubo's arise in the Groin; as also Warts in the <i>Glans</i>
  and <i>Præputium</i>; and <i>Condyloma's</i> in the <i>Anus</i>.</p>

  <p>Indeed the Pox may be easily cur'd in the beginning; but when it hath
  taken deep Root <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>by a long Continuance, it is not
  extirpated without much difficulty, more especially if it be accompany'd
  with Ulcers, <i>Caries</i>, and <i>Exostoses</i>; the Person afflicted
  with it being of an ill Constitution, and his Voice grown hoarse.</p>

  <p>The Spring and Summer are the proper Seasons of the Year for
  undertaking the Cure of this Disease: In order to which, it is necessary
  that the Patient begin with a regular Diet, lodging in a warm place, and
  taking such Aliments as yield a good Juice; as Jelly-broath made with
  boil'd Fowl: Let him drink Sudorifick Decoctions, prepar'd with the Wood
  of <i>Guayacum</i>, <i>China</i>-Root, and <i>Sarsaparella</i>, and let
  him abstain from eating any thing that is high season'd: Let him take
  Clysters to keep his Body open; sometimes also he may be let Blood, and
  purg'd with half a Dram of Jalap, and fifteen Grains of <i>Mercurius
  Dulcis</i>. The Purgations may be re-iterated as often as it shall be
  judg'd convenient; and then the Patient may be bath'd for nine or ten
  Days, every Morning and Evening; during which time he may take volatile
  Salt of Vipers, the Dose being from six to sixteen Grains; or else
  Viper's-Grease from half a Dram to a whole Dram in Conserve of Roses.</p>

  <p>Afterward it will be necessary to proceed to Fluxing, which is caus'd
  by the means of Frictions with <i>Vuguentum Mercurii</i>, which is made
  of crude <i>Mercury</i> stirr'd about in a Mortar with Turpentine, and
  then the whole mingled with Hog's-Grease, one part of <i>Mercury</i>
  being usually put into two parts of Hog's-Grease. The Rubbing is begun at
  the Sole of the Feet, <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>by a long Continuance, it is not
  extirpated without ascending to the Legs, and the inside of the Thighs;
  but the Back-Bone must not be rubb'd at all; When the Persons are tender,
  or of a weak Constitution, a single Friction may be sometimes sufficient.
  Thus the Patient must be rubb'd at the Fire, after he hath taken a good
  Mess of Broath; but I would not advise it to be done with more than one
  or two Drams of <i>Mercury</i> at a time, without reckoning the Grease.
  Then the Patient must be dress'd with a Pair of Linnen-Drawers or
  Pantaloons, and laid in his Bed, where his Mouth may be lookt into from
  time to time, to see whether the <i>Mercury</i> hath taken effect; which
  may be easily known, by reason that his Tongue, Gums, and Palate swell
  and grow thick, his Head akes, his Breath is strong, his Face red, and he
  can scarce swallow his Spittle; or else he begins to Salivate.</p>

  <p>If none of these Signs appear, the Rubbing must be begun again in the
  Morning and Evening; then if no Salivation be perceiv'd, for sometimes
  four or five Frictions are made successively, a little <i>Mercurial
  Panacæa</i> may be taken inwardly, to promote it. During the Frictions,
  the Patient is to be nourish'd with Eggs, Broaths, and Gellies; he must
  also keep his Bed in a warm Room, and never rise till it shall be thought
  fit to stop the Salivation, which continues twenty or twenty five Days;
  or rather till it becomes Laudable; that is to say, till it be no longer
  stinking, nor colour'd, but clear and fluid.</p>

  <p>If a Looseness shou'd happen during the Salivation, it wou'd cease, so
  that to renew it, <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>the Looseness may be stay'd with Clysters
  made of Milk and the Yolks of Eggs; and in case the Salivation shou'd not
  begin afresh, it must be excited with a slight Friction: But if it
  shoul'd be too violent, it may be diminish'd by some gentle Purge, or
  with four or five Grains of <i>Aurum Fulminans</i>, taken in Conserve of
  Roses.</p>

  <p>Three or four Pints of Rheum are commonly salivated every Day in a
  Bason made for that purpose, which the Patient holds in his Bed near his
  Mouth, so as the Spittle may run into it. But if the Fluxing shou'd not
  cease of it self at the time when it ought, he must be purg'd to put a
  stop thereto. If any Ulcers remain in his Mouth, to dry 'em up,
  Gargarisms are to be often us'd, which are made of Barley-Water, Honey of
  Roses, or luke-warm Wine.</p>

  <p>The Warts are cur'd by binding 'em, if a Ligature be possible, or else
  they may be consum'd with Causticks, such as the Powder of Savine, or
  <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, by corroding the neighbouring Parts; sometimes they
  are cut, left to bleed for a while, and bath'd with warm Wine.</p>

  <p>When the Patient begins to rise, he must be purg'd, his Linnen, Bed,
  and Chamber being chang'd; and afterward his Strength is to be recruited
  with good Victuals, and generous Wine. If he were too much weaken'd, let
  him take Cow's-Milk with <i>Saccharum Rosatum</i>.</p>

  <p>If the Pox were not inveterate, the Fluxing might be excited by the
  <i>Panacæa</i> alone, without any Frictions: For after the Phlebotomy,
  <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>{175}</span>Purgations, and Bathings duly
  administer'd; the Patient might take ten Grains of the <i>Mercurial
  Panacæa</i> in the Morning, and as many at Night; on the next Day fifteen
  Grains might be given, and the like quantity at Night; on the third Day
  twenty Grains might be given both Morning and Evening; on the fourth Day
  twenty five Grains in the Morning, and as many at Night; and on the fifth
  Day thirty Grains in the Morning, and the very same quantity in the
  Evening; continuing thus to augment the Dose, till the Fluxing comes in
  abundance; and it may be maintain'd by giving every two or every three
  Days twelve Grains of the <i>Panacæa</i>. This Course must be continually
  follow'd till the Salivation becomes Laudable, and the Symptoms
  cease.</p>

<h3><i>The manner of making the </i>Mercurial
Panacæa<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>To prepare this <i>Panacæa</i>, it is requisite to take <i>Mercury</i>
  reviv'd from <i>Cinnabar</i>, because it is more pure than <i>Mercury</i>
  which is immediately dug out of the Mine. The <i>Mercury</i> is reviv'd
  with <i>Cinnabar</i>, after this manner: Take a Pound of artificial
  <i>Cinnabar</i> pulveriz'd, and mingled exactly with three Pounds of
  unslack'd Lime, in like manner beaten to Powder: Let this Mixture be put
  into a Retort of Stone, or Glass luted, the third part of which at least
  remains empty; Let it be plac'd in a reverberating Furnace; and after
  having fitted a Recipient fill'd with Water, let the whole be left during
  twenty four Hours at least; then let the Fire be <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>put under it by
  degrees, and at length let the Heat be very much augmented, whereupon the
  <i>Mercury</i> will run Drop by Drop into the Recipient: Let the Fire be
  continu'd till nothing comes forth, and the Operation will be perform'd
  generally in six or seven Hours: Then pour the Water out of the
  Recipient, and having wash'd the <i>Mercury</i>, to cleanse it from some
  small quantity of Earth that may stick thereto, let it be dry'd with
  Cloaths, or else with the Crum of Bread: Thus thirteen Ounces of
  <i>Mercury</i> may be drawn off from every Pound of artificial
  Cinnabar.</p>

  <p>The <i>Panacæa</i> is made of sweet Sublimate, and the later of
  corrosive Sublimate: To make the corrosive Sublimate, put sixteen Ounces
  of <i>Mercury</i> reviv'd from Cinnabar, into a Matrass, pour upon it
  eighteen Ounces of Spirit of Nitre; place the Matras upon the Sand, which
  must be somewhat hot, and leave it there till the Dissolution be
  effected: Then pour off this dissolved Liquor, which will be as clear as
  Water, into a Glass Vial, or into a Stone-Jug, and let its Moisture
  evaporate gently over the Sand-Fire, till a white Mass remains; which you
  may pulverize in a Glass Mortar, mingling it with sixteen Ounces of
  Vitriol calcin'd, and as much decrepited Salt: Put this Mixture into a
  Matras, two third parts of which remain empty, and the Neck of which hath
  been cut in the middle of its height; then fix the Matras in the Sand,
  and begin to kindle a gentle Fire underneath, which may be continu'd for
  three Hours; afterwards let Coals be thrown upon it till the Fire burn
  very vehemently, and a Sublimate <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>will arise on the top
  of the Matras; so that the Operation may be perform'd within the space of
  six or seven Hours. Let the Matras be cool'd, and afterward broken;
  avoiding a kind of Flower or light Powder, which flyes up into the Air as
  soon as this Matter is remov'd; whereupon you'll find nineteen Ounces of
  very good corrosive Sublimate; but the red <i>Scoria</i> or Dross which
  settleth at the bottom must be cast away as unprofitable. This Sublimate
  being a powerful <i>Escarotick</i>, eats away proud Flesh, and is of
  singular use in cleansing old Ulcers. If half a Dram thereof be dissolv'd
  in a Pint of Lime-Water, it gives a yellow Tincture; and this is that
  which is call'd the <i>Phagedonick-Water</i>.</p>

  <p>The sweet Sublimate, of which the <i>Panacæa</i> is immediately
  compos'd, is made with sixteen Ounces of corrosive Sublimate, pulveriz'd
  in a Marble or Glass-Mortar, intermixing with it by little and little,
  twelve Ounces of <i>Mercury</i> reviv'd from Cinnabar: Let this Mixture
  be stirr'd about with a Wooden Pestle, till the Quick-silver become
  imperceptible; then put the Powder, which will be of a grey Colour, into
  divers Glass-Vials, or into a Matras, of which two third parts remain
  empty; place your Vessel on the Sand, and kindle a small Fire in the
  beginning, the Heat of which may be afterward encreas'd to the third
  Degree: Let it continue in this Condition till the Sublimate be made; and
  the Operation will be generally consummated <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>in four or five Hours:
  whereupon you may break your Vial, and throw away as useless, a little
  light Earth that lies at the bottom. You must also separate that which
  sticks to the Neck of the Vials, or of the Matras, and keep it for
  Ointments against the Itch; but carefully gather together the white
  Matter which lies in the middle, and having pulveriz'd it, cause it to be
  sublimated in the Vials or Matras, as before. This Matter must also be
  separated again (as we have already shown) and put into other Vials to be
  sublimated a third time. Lastly, the terrestrial parts in the bottom, and
  the fuliginous in the Neck of the Vials, must be, in like manner,
  separated, still preserving the Sublimate in the middle, which will then
  be very well dulcify'd, and amount to the quantity of twenty five Ounces
  and an half: It is an Efficacious Remedy for all sorts of Venereal
  Diseases; removes Obstructions, kills Worms, and purgeth gently by stool,
  being taken in Pills from six Grains to thirty.</p>

<h3><i>Of the proper Composition of the </i>Mercurial
Panacæa<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take what quantity you please of sweet Sublimate, reduce it to Powder
  in a Marble or Glass-Mortar, and put it into a Matras, three quarters
  whereof remain empty, and of which you have cut off the Neck in <!-- Page
  179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>the middle
  of its Height: Then place this Matras in a Furnace or <i>Balneum</i> of
  Sand, and make a little Fire underneath for an Hour, to give a gentle
  Heat to the Matter, which may be augmented by little and little to the
  third degree: Let it continue in this state about five Hours, and the
  Matter will be sublimated within that space of time. Then let the Vessel
  cool, and break it, throwing away as unprofitable a little light sort of
  Earth, of a reddish Colour, which is found at the bottom, and separating
  all the Sublimate from the Glass. Afterward pulverize it a second time,
  and let it be sublimated in a Matras, as before: Thus the Sublimations
  must be reiterated seven several times, changing the Matrasses every
  time, and casting away the light Earth. Then having reduc'd your
  Sublimate to a very fine impalpable Powder, by grinding it upon a
  Porphyry or Marble Stone, put it into a Glass Cucurbite or Gourd, pour
  into it alkaliz'd Spirit of Wine to the height of four Fingers; cover the
  Cucurbite with its Head, and leave the Matter in Infusion during fifteen
  Days, stirring it about from time to time with an Ivory <i>Spatula</i>.
  Afterward set your Cucurbite in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>, or in a Vaporous
  Bath, make fit a Recipient to the Mouth of the Alembick; lute the Joints
  exactly with a moistened Bladder, and cause all the Spirit of Wine to be
  destill'd with a moderate Fire: Let the Vessels be cool'd, and unluted,
  and the <i>Panacæa</i> will appear at the bottom of the Cucurbite. If it
  be not <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>already dry enough, you may dry it up with
  a gentle Fire in the Sand, stirring it with an Ivory or Wooden
  <i>Spatula</i> in the Cucurbite it self till it be reduc'd to Powder. It
  may be kept for use in a Glass-Vessel, as a Remedy of very great Efficacy
  for all sorts of <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Venenereal'."
  >Venereal</span> Diseases, as also for Obstructions, the Scurvy,
  <i>Scrophula</i> or Kings-Evil, Tettar, Scab, Scurf, Worms,
  <i>Ascarides,</i> inveterate Ulcers, <i>&amp;c.</i> The Dose is from six
  Grains to two Scruples, in Conserve of Roses.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Dislocation of the Bones.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What are the Diseases incident to the Bones?</i></p>

  <p>They are five in number, <i>viz.</i> Dislocation, Fracture,
  <i>Caries</i> or Ulcer, <i>Exostosis</i>, and <i>Nodus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Dislocation or Luxation?</i></p>

  <p>It is the starting of the Head of one Bone out of the Cavity of
  another, with an <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>Interdiction of the proper Motion of the
  Part: Or else it is the disjointing of two Bones united together for the
  Motion of a Part.</p>

  <p><i>How many causes are there of Dislocation in general?</i></p>

  <p>Two, that is to say, one violent, and the other gentle; thus the
  Dislocation is made violently in Falls, Strains, Knocks, and Blows; but
  it is done gently and slowly in Defluctions of Rheum; as also by an
  insensible gathering together of Humours between the Joints, and upon the
  Ligaments, the Relaxation or loosening of which gives occasion afterward
  to the Head of the Bone to go out of its place; whence this Consequence
  may well be drawn, <i>viz.</i> that a violent Dislocation usually depends
  upon an external Cause, and a gentle Dislocation upon an internal.</p>

  <p><i>After how many manners doth a Dislocation happen?</i></p>

  <p>Two several Ways; <i>viz.</i> the first is called compleat, total, and
  perfect; and the second incompleat, partial, and imperfect: But both may
  happen before, behind, on the inside, and without; and may also be simple
  or complicated.</p>

  <p><i>What are the signs of a perfect, total, and compleat
  Dislocation?</i></p>

  <p>It is when a hard Tumour or Swelling is perceiv'd near a Hole in the
  place of the Joint, great pain being felt in the Part, and the Motion of
  it abolish'd.</p>

  <p><i>What are the signs of an imperfect, partial, and incompleat
  Dislocation?</i> <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span></p>

  <p>It is when the Motion is streighten'd, and weaker than ordinary, so
  that some Pain is felt in the Joynt, and a Deformity may be discern'd
  therein, by comparing the hurt Part with the opposite which is found:
  This Dislocation is otherwise call'd a Sprain, when it proceeds from an
  external Cause; or else it is termed a Relaxation, when it happens by an
  internal.</p>

  <p><i>What is a simple, and what is a complicated Dislocation or
  Luxation?</i></p>

  <p>The Dislocation is properly simple, when it hath no concomitant
  Accidents; and it is complicated when accompany'd with some ill Symptoms
  or Accidents, such as Swellings, Inflammations, Wounds, Fractures,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>What are the means proper to be us'd in a simple
  Dislocation?</i></p>

  <p>A speedy and simple reducing thereof, which is perform'd by stretching
  out the dislocated or luxated Member, and thrusting back the Head of the
  Bone into its natural place. Afterward the Joynt must be strengthen'd
  with a Fomentation made with Provence Roses, the Leaves of Wormwood,
  Rosemary, Camomile, St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, and Oak-Moss boil'd in the
  Lees of Wine and Forge-Water, keeping the Part well bound up, and
  sustain'd in a convenient situation. But if any ill Consequence is to be
  fear'd, apply <i>Emplastrum Oxycroceum</i>, or <i>Diapalma</i> dissolv'd
  in Wine.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in a complicated Dislocation?</i> <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span></p>

  <p>The Accidents must be first remov'd, and then the Bone may be set,
  which is impossible to be done otherwise; it being dangerous even to make
  an Attempt before, by reason of the too great Violence with which it is
  effected, and which would infallibly produce a Convulsion or a
  Gangrene.</p>

  <p><i>If the Dislocation be accompany'd with a Wound, must the Wound be
  cur'd before any Endeavours are us'd to reduce it?</i></p>

  <p>No, but the Symptoms of the Wound, which hinder the Operation, must be
  taken away, as the Swelling, Inflammation, and others of the like Nature;
  and then it may be reduc'd, and the Wound may be dress'd according to the
  usual Method.</p>

  <p><i>If the Dislocation be complicated with the Fracture, what is to be
  done then?</i></p>

  <p>It is necessary to begin with reducing of the Dislocation, and
  afterward to perform that of the Fracture, by reason of the Extension
  which must be made to reduce the Dislocation, which would absolutely
  hinder the Setling of the Fracture.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Inflammation and Swelling to be asswag'd?</i></p>

  <p>With Linnen Cloaths dipt in Brandy and common Water, which must be
  often renew'd; or else with the Tops of Wormwood and Camomile, with Sage
  and Rosemary boil'd in the Lees of Wine, wherein the Bolsters and Bands
  are to be steep'd. But all Repercussives and Astringents must be
  avoided.</p>

  <p><i>How doth it appear that the Reduction is well perform'd?</i> <!--
  Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span></p>

  <p>By the Re-establishment of the Part in its natural State; by its being
  free from Pain; by its regular Motion; and by its conformity to the
  opposite Part which is found.</p>

  <p><i>What Dislocations of Parts are most difficult to be
  reduc'd?</i></p>

  <p>They are those of the Thighs with the Huckle-Bones, which are almost
  never perfectly set; that of the first <i>Vertebra's</i> is extremely
  difficult to be reduc'd; and those of the Lower-Jaw and Soles of the Feet
  are mortal.</p>

  <p>The reducing of Dislocations is perform'd with greater facility in
  Infants than in Persons advanc'd in Years; but it becomes most difficult
  when it is deferr'd for many Days, by reason of the overflowing of the
  <i>Lympha</i> and nutritious Juice.</p>

  <p>If an Inflammation shou'd happen before the Member is reduc'd, nothing
  can be done till it be allay'd, as we have already intimated; but to
  prevent and mitigate it, the dislocated Joynt, and the neighbouring
  Parts, may be bath'd with luke-warm Wine, in which hath been boil'd the
  Tops of St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, Camomile, Rosemary, <i>St&oelig;cas
  Arabica</i>, and other Ingredients of the like Nature; the Bands must be
  also steept in the same Liquor.</p>

  <p>If an <i>Oedematous</i> Tumour arise in the luxated Member after the
  Joint hath been set, it is requisite to take internal Sudorificks, and to
  apply Liniments made with the destill'd Oil of Tartar, and of Human
  Bones, which may be rectify'd with burnt Hart's Horn, or some other part
  of Animals, to take away its stink: Or else take yellow-Wax, and very
  white Rosin, <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span>melt the whole Mass, and put into it white
  Amber and Gum <i>Elemi</i>, a sufficient quantity of each to make a
  Composition to be incorporated with Balsam of <i>Peru</i>; a Plaister of
  which may be prepar'd, and apply'd to the dislocated Member; but the
  Plaister must not be laid a cross, lest it shou'd contract the Part too
  much. The whole Member may be also anointed with Oil of St.
  <i>John</i>'s-Wort, or with the destill'd Oil of Turpentine; or rather
  with a simple Decoction of Nervous Plants in Wine.</p>

  <p>If the Bone be put out of its place by a coagulated sort of Matter
  like Mortar or Plaister, Resolutives and Attenuants are to be us'd, such
  as the volatile Spirit of Tartar prepar'd with the Lees of Wine, volatile
  Spirit of Tartar destill'd with Nitre in a Retort with a long Neck, or
  Spirit of Tartar prepar'd by Fermentation with Tartar, and its proper
  <i>Alkali</i>: This last is the best of all, and the use thereof ought to
  be continu'd. The volatile Salt of Human Bones is also very efficacious;
  but it is necessary to begin first with the taking of Laxative and
  Sudorifick Medicines, appropriated according to the respective
  Circumstances. The Spirit of Earth-Worms may be also apply'd outwardly,
  which is made by Fermentation, and may be often laid on the Part either
  alone, or with the Spirit of <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>.</p>

  <p>If a dislocated Bone be not set in good time, a <i>Coagulum</i> or
  kind of curdled Substance is form'd in the Cavity, which hinders the
  reducing of it to its place; but this <i>Coagulum</i> may be dissolv'd
  with the following Medicament, before you attempt to set the Bone. Take
  one <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>part of the destill'd Oil of Human Bones,
  two parts of f&oelig;tid Oil of Tartar; mingle the whole, and add quick
  Lime to be destill'd in a Retort: Let the Parts be fomented with this
  Oil.</p>

  <p>If the Dislocation happen'd by the Relaxation of the Ligaments,
  recourse may be had to universal Sudorificks taken inwardly; as also to
  such Medicines as are full of an unctuous and volatile Salt, particularly
  Aromatick Oils, and Spirit of <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>. In the mean while
  Aromaticks, Resolutives, and moderate Astringents may be apply'd
  outwardly.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fractures of Bones.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is the Fracture of a Bone?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Division of the Continuity of its Parts.</p>

  <p><i>After how many different manners may a Bone be broken?</i></p>

  <p>Three several ways, <i>viz.</i> cross-wise, side-wise, in its length,
  and perhaps in Shatters or Splinters.</p>

  <p><i>By what means may a Bone be fractured?</i></p>

  <p>It may happen to be done by three sorts of Instruments, <i>viz.</i>
  such as are fit for bruising, cutting, or wresting; that is to say, a
  Bone may be divided in the Continuity of its proper Parts, by Contusion,
  Incision, or Contorsion.</p>

  <p><i>How is the Fracture of a Bone discover'd?</i> <!-- Page 188
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span></p>

  <p>Divers ways, <i>viz.</i> by the ill Disposition of the Part, which
  becomes shorter; by its want of Motion; by its flexibility or pliantness
  elsewhere than in its Articulations; by the unevenness that may be
  perceiv'd in its Continuity; by the cracking which is heard; sometimes
  also by the shooting forth of one of its ends thro' the Flesh which it
  hath open'd; and lastly by a Comparison made thereof with the sound Part
  on the other side, as that of the Right Arm with the Left.</p>

  <p><i>What kind of Fracture is most difficult to be discern'd?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which happens in the length of the Bone, commonly call'd a
  Cleft or Fissure, which gives occasion to very great Symptoms when it is
  unknown: But it may be found out by the Pain and Swelling felt at the
  bottom of the Cleft in touching it; besides the Conjectures which may be
  made from the Relation of the Person who hath had a Fall, and might have
  heard the cracking of the Bone.</p>

  <p><i>What sort of Fracture is most difficult to be cur'd?</i></p>

  <p>The shattering or splitting of a Bone in Pieces, by reason of the
  great Number of Splints which daily cause new Pains and Suppurations.</p>

  <p><i>What is a simple and what is a complicated Fracture?</i></p>

  <p>The simple Fracture is that whereby the Bone is broken, without any
  other Accident; and the complicated Fracture is that which is follow'd by
  some Accident; as that in which there is a splitting of the Bone in
  pieces, or <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>where the Bone is broken in two several
  places, or else when the Fracture is accompany'd with a Luxation, a
  Wound, an Inflammation, or other Circumstances of the like Nature.</p>

  <p><i>Are old Men or Children most subject to these Fractures of the
  Bones?</i></p>

  <p>Old Men, because their Bones are drier; whereas those of Infants are
  almost Cartilaginous, and yield or give way to the violence offer'd to
  'em; from whence proceed the sinkings and hollowness that happen in their
  Skulls, especially in the Mould of their Heads, or elsewhere; for which a
  Remedy is found out by the means of Plaisters, Splints, and Bandages,
  fitted to the shape of the Parts. It is also on the same Account that
  Bones are more easily broken in the Winter than in the Summer.</p>

  <p><i>In what Parts are the Fractures of Bones most dangerous?</i></p>

  <p>They are those that happen in the Skull and Joints; in the former by
  reason of the Brain; and in the latter in regard of the Nervous
  Parts.</p>

  <p><i>What Course is to be taken by a Surgeon who is sent for to cure a
  Fracture?</i></p>

  <p>He ought to do three things, that is to say, at first he must
  incessantly endeavour to reduce it, to the end that Nature may re-unite
  the Parts with greater Facility, and that its Extremities may be brought
  together again with less trouble, before a Swelling, Inflammation, or
  Gangrene happen in the Part. Afterward he is to use means to retain the
  Parts in their proper Figure, and <!-- Page 190 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>natural Situation, and
  to prevent all sorts of Accidents.</p>

  <p><i>How is the setting of a broken Bone to be perform'd?</i></p>

  <p>When the Fracture is Cross-wise, it must be reduc'd by Extension and
  contra-Extension; and when it is in length, the Coaptation or bringing
  together again of the Sides, is only necessary.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done in a Fracture complicated with a Wound?</i></p>

  <p>The Operator must first reduce it, and then administer the other
  Helps, as in a simple Fracture.</p>

  <p><i>How may it be known that the reducing of the Fracture is well
  perform'd?</i></p>

  <p>When the Pain ceaseth; when the Part hath resum'd its natural Shape;
  when no Unevenness is any longer perceiv'd therein; and when it is
  conformable to the sound Part on the other side.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Signs which shew that the Splints remain in the
  Fracture after it hath been reduc'd?</i></p>

  <p>They are the secret and continual Workings of the Fibres, or
  twitchings, that are felt by Intervals in the Part, with great Pains,
  which are the Indications of an Abcess arising therein; and when a Wound
  is join'd to the Fracture, the Lips of it are puff'd up, and become more
  soft and pale, the purulent Matter abounding also more than ordinary.</p>

  <p><i>When the Splints appear, must they be drawn out by force?</i> <!--
  Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span></p>

  <p>By no means; for great care ought to be taken to avoid all manner of
  violent Operations; it being requisite to wait for their going out with
  the purulent Matter; or at most to facilitate their Passage by the use of
  Injections of the Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes; by the application of
  <i>Emplastrum Andreæ Crucii</i>, and by the help of the
  <i>Forceps</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How is a simple Fracture to be dress'd, after it hath been
  reduc'd?</i></p>

  <p>The Parts are to be strengthen'd and consolidated with Liniments of
  <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i>, or of Oil of St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort mingled
  with Wine, Brandy, or <i>Aqua-Vitæ;</i> with Fomentations of Red Roses,
  Rosemary, and St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort boil'd in Wine; and with
  <i>Emplastrum contra Rupturam</i>, or <i>de Betonica</i>, carefully
  wrapping up the broken Member, but after such a manner that the two
  Extremities may not cross one another; and that a small Space may remain
  open between both. Afterward the Splints and Bands are to be apply'd,
  taking care to avoid binding 'em too hard, and to take 'em off every
  three Days, in order to refit 'em, to abate troublesome Itchings, and to
  give Air to the Part; by these means preventing the Gangrene, which might
  happen by the Suffocation of the natural Heat. If the Thighs or Legs are
  broken, Scarves are to be us'd to support and stay 'em in the Bed.</p>

  <p><i>What space of time may there be allow'd for curing the Fracture of
  a Bone?</i></p>

  <p>The Cure will take up more or less time, according to the variety of
  the Parts, or the different thickness of the Bones: Thus to form <!--
  Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>the
  <i>Callus</i> of the broken Jaw-Bone, twenty Days may well be allotted;
  for that of the Clavicle, or that of the Shoulder-Bone, twenty four; for
  that of the Bones of the Elbow, thirty; for that of the Arm-Bone, forty;
  for that of the Wrist-Bone, and those of the Fingers, twenty; for that of
  the Ribs, twenty; for that of the Thigh-Bone, fifty; for that of the
  Leg-Bone, forty; for that of the Bones of the <i>Tarsus</i> and Toes,
  twenty.</p>

  <p><i>What ought to be done in particular to promote the formation of the
  </i>Callus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>The fractur'd Part must be rubb'd with <i>Oleum Lumbricorum</i> and
  Spirit of Wine heated and mingled together: The Decoctions of Agrimony,
  Sayine, and Saxifrage are also to be us'd, and the <i>Lapis
  Osteocolla</i> is a Specifick: It is usually given in great
  Comphrey-Water, or in a Decoction of Perewinkle made with Wine, and is
  often re-iterated.</p>

<h3><i>Of the particular Fractures of the
Skull.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Fracture of the</i> Cranium <i>or Skull?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Wound of the Head complicated with a Fracture of the
  Skull-Bone.</p>

  <p><i>After how many manners may the Skull be fractur'd?</i> <!-- Page
  193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span></p>

  <p>Three several ways, <i>viz.</i> by Contusion, by Incision, and by
  Puncture.</p>

  <p><i>What is the most dangerous of these Fractures?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which happens by Contusion; because the Concussion and
  Commotion is greater.</p>

  <p><i>Do all the Fractures of the Skull require the use of the
  Trepan?</i></p>

  <p>No, the Fractures must be deep which stand in need of the help of such
  an Instrument; for those that are superficial may be cur'd by a simple
  Exfoliation.</p>

  <p><i>What is that deep Fracture, wherein the use of the Trepan is
  absolutely necessary?</i></p>

  <p>It is that which is made in the two Tables of the Skull, penetrating
  to the <i>Meninges</i> of the Brain; upon which at that time the Blood is
  diffus'd, and must be taken away by the Operation of the Trepan.</p>

  <p><i>How may it be discover'd that the two Tables of the Skull are
  broken?</i></p>

  <p>By the Eyes, and by Ratiocination.</p>

  <p><i>Are not the Eyes sufficient alone, and are they not more certain
  than Ratiocination?</i></p>

  <p>Yes; but forasmuch as things are not always seen, there is often a
  necessity of making use of rational Deductions to find out that which the
  Eyes cannot discern.</p>

  <p><i>When doth it happen that the Eyes alone discover the
  Fracture?</i></p>

  <p>When the Wound is large and wide, so that it may be immediately
  view'd.</p>

  <p><i>When doth it happen that Ratiocination supplies the defect of the
  Eyes?</i> <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span></p>

  <p>When the Wound is so small that the Bone cannot be seen, and nothing
  appears but the Accidents.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Accidents or Signs of the Fracture of the
  Skull?</i></p>

  <p>They are a dimmness of the Sight, and loss of the Understanding, which
  happen at the very Moment when the Fall or Blow is receiv'd; with the
  Phlegmatick Vomittings that follow soon after: These Signs are call'd
  <i>Univocal</i>. And there are others that bear the Name of
  <i>Equivocal</i>, and which confirm the former; as a Flux of Blood thro'
  the Nose, Eyes, and Ears, redness of the Eyes, heaviness of the Head, and
  puffing up of the Face; as also afterward Drowsiness, Shivering of the
  whole Body, Fever, <i>Deliriums</i>, Convulsions, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><i>Must all these Signs appear before a Determination can be made of
  the necessity of using the Trepan?</i></p>

  <p>No, it is sufficient to have the Univocal Signs to make a Crucial
  Incision in the place of the Wound, and to lay bare the Bone, in order to
  observe the Fracture, which sometimes is so fine, that the Operator is
  oblig'd to make use of Ink, which insinuates it self into the Cleft, and
  of a particular Instrument, with which the black Line that hath
  penetrated to the bottom, cannot be rubb'd out; whereas it may be easily
  defac'd when the Fracture is only superficial.</p>

  <p><i>How long time is commonly spent before the appearing of the
  Accidents?</i></p>

  <p>In the Summer Season they appear in three or four Days, and at the
  latest in seven; in Winter <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>{195}</span>they are slower, and sometimes do not
  happen till the fourteenth Day: But at the end of this term, it may be
  affirm'd that the Trepan is often unprofitable.</p>

  <p><i>What is requisite to be done in a doubtful Occasion; Must the
  Trepan be apply'd or omitted?</i></p>

  <p>The Surgeon is to have recourse to his own conscientious Discretion,
  which ought to serve as a Guide, and requires that we should always act
  according to the known Rules of Art; insomuch that after having well
  consider'd the Accidents, with all the Circumstances of the Wound, if
  there be no good grounds for the undertaking of the Operation, it is
  expedient to desist, and in this case to have deference to the Advice of
  other able Surgeons of the same Society, rather than to rely too much
  upon his own Judgment, to the end that he may be always secure from all
  manner of Blame.</p>

  <p><i>Is the Trepan apply'd upon the Fracture?</i></p>

  <p>No; but on one side of it, and always in a firm place.</p>

  <p><i>What Course is to be taken when a Fracture is found in a
  Suture?</i></p>

  <p>A double Trepan is to be made, and apply'd on each side of the Suture,
  by reason of the overflowing of the Blood, which may happen therein.</p>

  <p><i>What Method ought to be observ'd in the curing of the Wounds of the
  Head, and Fractures of the Skull?</i></p>

  <p>In simple Wounds of the Head, it is necessary only to make use of
  Balsams, and to lay over 'em <i>Emplastrum de Betonica</i>. When there is
  a Contusion either in the <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span><i>Pericranium</i>, or in the Skull, the
  Wound must be kept open till after the Suppuration or Exfoliation.</p>

  <p>When there is only a Bunch without any Wound or Accident, it must
  speedily be dissolv'd with Plaister or Mortar, Chimney-Soot, Oil of
  Olives, and Wine, laid upon the Part between two Linnen-Rags; or else
  with Soot, Spirit of Wine, and Oil of St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort, wherein the
  Bolsters are soakt, to be in like manner apply'd with a Band.</p>

  <p>Wounds of the Head accompany'd with a Fracture, absolutely require the
  application of the Trepan, wherein it is requisite to make use of Oil of
  Turpentine to be dropt upon the Membrane of the Brain; or else Spirit of
  Wine mingled with Oil of Almonds, and not with the Oil or Syrrup of
  Roses; and to endeavour to cause a plentiful outward Suppuration.</p>

  <p>Besides, it must not be neglected to enjoyn the wounded Person to be
  let Blood both before and after the Operation, if he hath a Fever or a
  Plethory; and more especially it is to be remember'd to cause his Body to
  be kept open at least every other Day, with Clysters, obliging him to
  keep a good Diet, and to avoid all violent Agitations both of Body and
  Mind, abstaining from eating Flesh till the Fourteenth Day. All manner of
  Venery and Conjugal Embraces, which prove fatal at this time, are to be
  prohibited during forty Days, to be counted from the Day of the
  Operation; as they are also in all other considerable Wounds.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> IV.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Caries<i> or Ulcer of the Bones,
</i>Exostosis<i>, and </i>Nodus<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is</i> Caries?</p>

  <p>It is the Putrifaction of the Substance of the Bone, or else its Ulcer
  or Gangrene.</p>

  <p><i>Whence doth the </i>Caries<i> of the Bone derive its
  Original?</i></p>

  <p>It proceeds from an internal and external Cause; the former being that
  which hath been produc'd at first in the Substance of the Bone; and the
  other that which takes its Rise from an inveterate Ulcer in the Flesh,
  which hath communicated its Malignity to the Substance of the Bone, and
  by that means corrupted it.</p>

  <p><i>How is the </i>Caries<i> known which proceeds from an inward
  Cause?</i></p>

  <p>By the continual and violent Pains which are felt before, and continue
  for a long time without diminution; as also afterward by the alteration
  of the Flesh that covers the Bone, and which becomes soft, spongy, and
  livid.</p>

  <p><i>By what means is a </i>Caries<i> that derives its Origine from an
  outward Cause, discover'd?</i></p>

  <p>By the quality of the purulent Matter that issueth out of the Ulcer in
  the Flesh, which is blackish, Unctuous, and extremely stinking; as also
  by the help of the Probe, that discovereth <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>asperity or roughness
  in the Bone when it is laid bare.</p>

  <p><i>What Means are to be us'd in order to cure a </i>Caries<i>
  proceeding from an external Cause?</i></p>

  <p>The Powder of Flower-de-luce may be us'd, and it is sufficient for
  that purpose, when the <i>Caries</i> is superficial; but it is necessary
  to take <i>Oleum Guyaci</i>, and to soak Bolsters therein, to be laid
  upon the Ulcer when it is deep; or else <i>Aqua-Vitæ</i> or Brandy, in
  which have been infus'd the Roots of Flower-de-luce, Cinnamon, and
  Cloves. Lastly, the actual Cautery, which is Fire, must be apply'd
  thereto.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done when the </i>Caries<i> proceeds from an internal
  Cause?</i></p>

  <p>The Flesh must be open'd to give Passage to the <i>Sanies</i> that
  runs out of the ulcerated Bone, to the end that Exfoliation may be
  procur'd; and if the Ulcer hath not as yet laid open the Bone on the
  outside, the Trepan ought to be apply'd; but the Ulcer or <i>Caries</i>
  must be afterward handled, as we have even now declar'd.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Exostosis<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is the Swelling of a Bone made by the settling of a corrupt Humour
  in its proper Substance.</p>

  <p><i>What is </i>Nodus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a kind of gummy and wavering Tumour, which is form'd by the
  settling of a gross Humour between the Bone and the
  <i>Periosteum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Are </i>Exostoses<i> and </i>Nodus<i>'s suppurable Tumours?</i></p>

  <p>Yes, because they sometimes produce Ulcers and Gangrenes in the Bone,
  which are call'd <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>{199}</span><i>Caries</i>, proceeding from an internal
  Cause; nevertheless they are generally dissolv'd by Frictions with
  <i>Unguentum Griseum</i>, or by the application of Plaisters of Tobacco,
  or <i>Emplastrum de Vigo quadruplicato Mercurio</i>; taking also to the
  same purpose internal Diaphoretick and Sudorifick Medicines, with
  convenient Purgatives.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> V.</h3>

<h3><i>Of Cauteries, Vesicatories, Setons, Cupping-Glasses,
and Leeches.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is a Vesicatory?</i></p>

  <p>The Name of Vesicatory may be attributed to every thing that is
  capable of raising Bladders or Blisters in the Skin; nevertheless in
  Surgery, by a Vesicatory is understood a Medicament prepar'd with
  <i>Cantharides</i> or <i>Spanish</i> Flies dried, which are beaten to
  Powder, and mingled with Turpentine, Plaisters, Leaven, and other
  Ingredients.</p>

  <p><i>In what places, and after what manner are Vesicatories usually
  apply'd?</i></p>

  <p>They are apply'd every where, accordingly as there is occasion to draw
  out or discharge some Humour from a Part: In Defluxions of Rheum upon the
  Eyes or Teeth, they are laid on the Neck and Temples; in Apoplexies,
  behind the Ears; and so of the rest, observing always to make Frictions
  on the places where the <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>{200}</span>Application is to be made, to the end that
  the Vesicatory may sooner take effect.</p>

  <p><i>How long time must the Vesicatory continue on the Part?</i></p>

  <p>The Blisters are generally rais'd by 'em within the space of five or
  six Hours; yet this Operation depends more or less upon the fineness of
  the Skin; and when the Bladders or Blisters appear, it is requisite to
  deferr the openning of 'em for some time, to the end that Nature may have
  an Opportunity to introduce a new Scarf-Skin, by which means the Pain may
  be avoided that would be felt, if the Skin were too much expos'd to the
  Air.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Cautery?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Composition made of many Ingredients, which corrode, burn, and
  make an Escar on the Part to which they are apply'd.</p>

  <p><i>How many sorts of Cauteries are there in general?</i></p>

  <p>There are two kinds, <i>viz.</i> the Actual and the Potential; the
  former are those that have an immediate Operation; as Fire, or a red-hot
  Iron; and the others are those that produce the same Effect, but in a
  longer space of time; such are the ordinary Cauteries compos'd of
  Caustick Medicaments.</p>

  <p><i>Which are the most safe, the Actual or the Potential
  Cauteries?</i></p>

  <p>A distinction is to be made herein; for Actual Cauteries are safest in
  the Operation, because they may be apply'd wheresoever one shall think
  fit, as also for as long a time, or for any purpose: Whereas the
  Potential cannot be <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>guided after the same manner. But in
  Hæmorrhages the Potential Cauteries are most eligible, by reason that the
  Escar produc'd by 'em not being so speedily form'd, the Vessels are
  better clos'd, and they are not so subject to open again when it falls
  off; as it often happens in the Fall of an Escar made by Fire.</p>

  <p><i>In what places are Cauteries usually apply'd?</i></p>

  <p>In all places where an Attraction is to be made, or an Intemperature
  to be corrected, or a Flux of Humours to be stopt, by inducing an Escar
  on the Part: However they are commonly laid upon the Nape of the Neck,
  between the first and second <i>Vertebra</i>; on the outward Part of the
  Arm in a small Hole between the Muscle <i>Deltoides</i> and the
  <i>Biceps</i>; above the Thigh, between the Muscle <i>Sartor</i>, and the
  <i>Vastus Internus</i>; and on the inside of the Knee, below the Flexors
  of the Leg; observing every where that the Cautery be plac'd near the
  great Vessels, to the end that it may draw out and cleanse more
  abundantly.</p>

  <p><i>What is the Composition of the Potential Cauteries?</i></p>

  <p>They may be made with quick Lime, Soap, and Chimney-Soot; or else take
  an Ounce of <i>Sal Ammoniack</i>, two Ounces of burnt <i>Roman</i>
  Vitriol, three Ounces of quick Lime, and as many of calcin'd Tartar;
  mingle the whole Mass together in a <i>Lixivium</i> of Bean-Cod Ashes,
  and cause it to evaporate gently to a Consistence: Let this Paste be kept
  for use in a dry place, and in a well-stopt Vessel. Or else the
  Silver-Cautery, or <i>Lapis Infernalis</i> may be prepar'd after the
  following manner: <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>{202}</span></p>

  <p>Take what quantity you please of Silver, let it be dissolv'd with
  thrice as much Spirit of Nitre in a Vial, and set the Vial upon the
  Sand-Fire, to the end that two third parts of its Moisture may evaporate:
  Then pour the rest scalding-hot into a good Crucible, plac'd over a
  gentle Fire, and the Ebullition being made, the heat of the Fire must be
  augmented, till the Matter sink to the bottom, which will become as it
  were an Oil: Afterward pour it into a somewhat thick and hot Mould, and
  it will coagulate, so as to be fit for Use, if it be kept in a well-stopt
  Vial. This Cautery is the best; and an Ounce of Silver will yield one
  Ounce and five Drams of <i>Lapis Infernalis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Seton?</i></p>

  <p>It is a String of Silk, Thread, or Cotton, threaded thro' a kind of
  Pack-Needle, with which the Skin of a Part is to be pierc'd thro', to
  make an Ulcer therein, that hath almost the same effect as a Cautery.</p>

  <p><i>What is most remarkable in the Application of a Seton?</i></p>

  <p>It ought to be observ'd, that the String must be dipt in Oil of Roses,
  and that one end of it must always be kept longer than the other, to
  facilitate the running of the Humours.</p>

  <p><i>In what Parts is the <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'to Seton'."
  >Seton to</span> be apply'd?</i></p>

  <p>The Nape of the Neck is the usual place of its Application, altho' it
  may be made in any part of the Body where it is necessary. It sometimes
  happens that a Surgeon is oblig'd to use a kind of Seton in such Wounds
  made with a Sword, or by Gun-shot, as pass quite <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>thro' from one side to
  the other; then the String or Skain must be dipt in convenient Ointments
  or Medicinal Compositions; and as often as the Dressings are taken away,
  it will be requisite to cut off the Part soakt in the Purulent Matter,
  which must be taken out of the Ulcer.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Cupping-Glass?</i></p>

  <p>It is a Vessel or kind of Vial, made with Glass, the bottom whereof is
  somewhat broader than the top, which is apply'd to the Skin to cause an
  Attraction. There are two sorts of these Cupping-Glasses, <i>viz</i>, the
  Dry, and the Wet; the former are those that are laid upon the Skin
  without opening it; and the latter those that are apply'd with
  Scarification.</p>

  <p><i>In what Diseases are Cupping-Glasses us'd?</i></p>

  <p>In all kinds where it is necessary to make any Attraction; but more
  especially in Apoplexies, Vapours in Women, Palsies, and other Distempers
  of the like Nature. But the Applications of Cupping-Glasses are
  altogether different; for in Apoplexes they are generally set upon the
  Shoulders or upon the <i>Coccyx</i>; in Vapours upon the inside of the
  Thighs; and in Palsies upon the Paralytick Part it self.</p>

  <p><i>What is a Leech?</i></p>

  <p>It is an Animal like a little Worm which sucks the Blood, and is
  commonly apply'd to Children and weak Persons, to serve instead of
  Phlebotomy: Leeches are also us'd for the discharging of a Defluxion of
  Humours in any Part; as also in the Hæmorrhoidal Veins when they are too
  full; in the <i>Varices</i> and in several parts of the Face. <!-- Page
  204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span></p>

  <p><i>What choice ought to be made of Leeches?</i></p>

  <p>It is requisite to take those that have their Backs greenish, and
  their Bellies red; as also to seek for 'em in a clear running Stream, and
  to cast away those that are black and hairy.</p>

<h3><i>Of Phlebotomy.</i></h3>

  <p><i>What is Phlebotomy?</i></p>

  <p>It is an evacuation of Blood procur'd by the artificial Incision of a
  Vein or Artery, with a design to restore Health.</p>

  <p><i>Which are the Vessels that are open'd in Phlebotomy or
  Blood-letting?</i></p>

  <p>They are in general all the Veins and Arteries of the Body,
  nevertheless some of 'em are more especially appropriated to this
  Operation; as the <i>Vena Præparata</i> in the Forehead; the
  <i>Ranulæ</i> under the Tongue; the Jugular Veins and Arteries in the
  Neck; the Temporal Arteries in the Temples; the <i>Cephalick</i>,
  <i>Median</i>, and <i>Basilick</i> Veins in the inside of the Elbow; the
  <i>Salvatella</i> between the Ring-Finger and the Little-Finger; the
  <i>Poplitæa</i> in the Ham; the <i>Saphena</i> in the internal
  <i>Malleolus</i> or Ankle; and the <i>Ischiatica</i> in the external.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Conditions requisite in the due performing of the
  Operation of Phlebotomy?</i></p>

  <p>They are these, <i>viz.</i> to make choice of a proper Vessel; not to
  open any at all Adventures; not to let Blood without necessity, nor <!--
  Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>without the Advice of a Physician; whose
  Office it is to determine the Seasons or Times convenient for that
  purpose; as that of Intermission in an Intermitting Fever; that of
  Cooling in the Summer; and that of Noon-tide in the Winter; and lastly,
  to take away different quantities of Blood; for in the Heat of Summer
  they ought to be lesser, and greater in the Winter.</p>

  <p><i>What are the Accidents of Phlebotomy?</i></p>

  <p>They are an Impostume, a <i>Rhombus</i>, an <i>Echymosis</i>, an
  <i>Aneurism</i>, Lipothymy, Swooning, and a Convulsion.</p>

  <p><i>What is a </i>Rhombus<i>?</i></p>

  <p>It is a small Tumour of the Blood which happens in the place where the
  Operation is perform'd either by making the Orifice too small, or larger
  than the Capaciousness of the Vessel will admit. The <i>Rhombus</i> is
  cur'd by laying upon it a Bolster dipt in fair Water, between the Folds
  of which must be put a little Salt, to dissolve and prevent the
  Suppuration.</p>

  <p><i>How may it be perceiv'd that an Artery hath been prickt or open'd
  in letting Blood?</i></p>

  <p>The Puncture of an Artery produceth an Aneurism; and the Opening of it
  causeth a Flux of Vermilion Colour'd Blood, which issueth forth in
  abundance, and by Leaps.</p>

  <p><i>Are the Leaps which the Blood makes in running, a certain Sign that
  it comes from an Artery?</i></p>

  <p>No, because it may so happen, that the <i>Basilick</i> Vein lies
  directly upon an Artery, the beating of which may cause the Blood of the
  <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span><i>Basilica</i> to run out leaping:
  Therefore these three Circumstances ought to be consider'd jointly, that
  is to say, the Vermilion Colour, the great quantity and the Leaps, in
  order to be assur'd that the Blood proceeds from an Artery.</p>

  <p><i>How may it be discover'd that a Tendon hath been hurt in letting
  Blood?</i></p>

  <p>It is known when in opening the <i>Median</i> Vein, the end of the
  Lancet hath met with some Resistance; when the Patient hath felt great
  Pain, and afterward when the Tendon apparently begins to be puff'd up,
  and the Arm to swell. A Remedy may be apply'd to this Accident thus;
  after having finish'd the Operation, a Bolster steep'd in
  <i>Oxycratum</i> is to be laid upon the Vessel, a proper Bandage is to be
  made, and the Arm must be wrapt up in a Scarf: If the Inflammation that
  ariseth in the Part be follow'd with Suppuration, it must be dress'd with
  a small Tent; and if the Suppuration be considerable, it is necessary to
  dilate the Wound, and to make use of Oil of Eggs and Brandy, or
  <i>Arcæus</i>'s Liniment, with a good Digestive; as also to apply
  <i>Emplastrum Ceratum</i>; to make an Embrocation on the Arm with Oil of
  Roses; and to dip the Bolsters in <i>Oxycratum</i> to cover the whole
  Part.</p>

  <p><i>Is it not to be fear'd that some Nerve may be wounded in letting
  Blood?</i></p>

  <p>No, they lie so deep that they cannot be touch'd.</p>

  <p><i>Under what Vein is the Artery of the Arm?</i></p>

  <p>It is usually situated under the <i>Basilica</i>. <!-- Page 207
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>{207}</span></p>

  <p><i>What Course is proper to be taken to avoid the Puncture of an
  Artery in letting Blood?</i></p>

  <p>It must be felt with the Hand before the Ligature is made, observing
  well whether it be deep or superficial; for when it lies deep, there is
  nothing to be fear'd; and when it is superficial, it may be easily
  avoided by pricking the Vein either higher or lower.</p>

  <p><i>What is to be done when an Artery is open'd?</i></p>

  <p>If it be well open'd, it is requisite to let the Blood run out till
  the Person falls into a <i>Syncope</i> or Swoon, by which means the
  Aneurism is prevented; and afterward the Blood will be more easily stopt:
  It remains only to make a good Bandage with many Bolsters, in the first
  of which is simply put a Counter or a Piece of Money; but a bit of Paper
  chew'd will serve much better, with Bolsters laid upon it in several
  Folds.</p>

  <p><i>If the Arteries cause so much trouble when open'd accidentally, why

  <p>By reason that in this place the Arteries are situated upon the Bones
  that press 'em behind; which very much facilitates their re-union.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the Trepan.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is to be perform'd, when it is inferr'd from the Signs
  of which we have already given a particular Account, that some Matter is
  diffus'd over the <i>Dura Mater</i>. The Trepan must not be us'd in the
  <i>Sinus Superciliares</i>, by reason of their Cavity; nor in the
  Sutures, in regard of the Vessels that pass thro' 'em; nor in the
  Temporal Bone without great necessity, especially in that part of it
  which is join'd to the Parietal-Bone, lest the end of this Bone shou'd
  fly out of its place, since it is only laid upon the Parietal; nor in the
  middle of the Coronal and Occipital-Bones, by reason of an inner <!--
  Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>Prominence wherein they adhere to the
  <i>Dura Mater</i>; nor in the Passage of the Lateral <i>Sinus's</i> that
  are situated on the side of the Occipital.</p>

  <p>If the Fissure be very small, the Trepan may be apply'd upon it,
  altho' it is more expedient to use this Instrument on the side of the
  Fissure in the lower part; neither is the Trepan to be set upon the
  Sinkings; and if the Bones are loosen'd or separated, there needs no
  other trepanning than to take 'em away with the Elevatory.</p>

  <p>The Operation must be begun with Incision, which is usually made in
  form of a Cross, if the Wound be remote from the Sutures, and there are
  no Muscles to be cut, and in the shape of the Letter T. or of the Figure
  7. if it be near the Sutures, so that the Foot of the 7. or of the T.
  ought to be parallel to the Suture, the top of the Letter descending
  toward the Temples; it is also made in the middle of the Forehead. If it
  be sufficient to make a longitudinal Incision in the Forehead; its
  Wrinkles may be follow'd, and there will be less Deformity in the Scar;
  but it is never done Crosswise in this Part, and the Lips of the Wound
  are not to be cut. If an Incision be made on the Muscle
  <i>Crotaphites</i>, and on those of the back-part of the Head, it may be
  done in form of the Letter V. the Point of which will stand at the bottom
  of the Muscles; nevertheless it is more convenient to make a longitudinal
  Incision, by which means fewer Fibres will be cut; and it is always
  requisite to begin at the lower part, to avoid being hindred by the
  Hæmorrhage. <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>The Incisions are to be made with the
  Incision-Knife, and that too boldly when there are no Sinkings; but if
  there be any, too much weight must not be laid upon 'em: Thus the
  Incision being finish'd, the Lips of the Skull are to be separated either
  with the Fingers, or some convenient Instrument; Then if there be no
  urgent Occasion to apply the Trepan, it may be deferr'd till the next
  Day, the Wound being dress'd in the mean time with Plaisters, Bolsters,
  Pledgets, and a large Kerchief or upper Dressing, the use of which we
  shall shew hereafter.</p>

  <p>The Operation is begun with the Perforative, to make a little Hole for
  the fixing of the Pyramid or Pin which is in the Round; afterward the
  Round is to be apply'd, holding the Handle of the Trepan with the
  Left-hand, and turning with the other very fast in the beginning; but
  when the Round hath made its way, it is lifted up to remove the Pin, lest
  this Point shou'd hurt the <i>Dura Mater</i>: Thus the Round being taken
  off from time to time, to be cleans'd from the Filings that stick
  thereto, is set on again, and the Operator begins his Work of turning
  anew, which must be carry'd on gently when any Blood appears, to the end
  that the first Table of the piece of Bone which is remov'd may not fly
  from the second: When it comes near the <i>Dura Mater</i>, the Operator
  must proceed, in like manner, gently, searching with a Feather round
  about the Bone, to observe whether he still continueth his Course in the
  Skull. He must also often lift up the Trepan to search the Hole, to
  cleanse the Instrument, and to keep <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>it from growing hot. As
  often as the Trepan is taken off, let him search with a Feather, to see
  whether the Bone be cut equally; and if it be not, he must lean more on
  that side which is least cut. If it be necessary to make use of the
  <i>Terebella</i>, the Hole must be made in the beginning, whilst the Bone
  is as yet firm; and when the Piece begins to move, the <i>Terebella</i>
  is to be put very gently into its Hole, without pressing the Bone, to
  draw it out; or else it may be taken away with the Myrtle-Leaf, which is
  an Instrument made of a firm Silver-Plate somewhat crooked. When the
  Piece is thus remov'd, the uneven Parts that remain at the bottom of the
  Hole, are to be cut with the <i>Lenticula</i>; and if there be any
  Sinkings, they may be rais'd with the Elevatory. Whereupon the <i>Dura
  Mater</i> may be compress'd a little with the <i>Lenticula</i>, to
  facilitate the running out of the Blood, the Wounded Person being oblig'd
  to stoop with his Head downward, stopping his Nose and Mouth, and holding
  his Breath for a while, to cause the Matter to run out: Then the <i>Dura
  Mater</i> may be wip'd with Lint; but if any <i>Pus</i> or corrupt Matter
  lies underneath, it must be pierc'd with a Lancet wrapt up in a Tent,
  that it may not be perceiv'd by the Assistants. Afterward a <i>Sindon</i>
  or very fine Linnen Rag dipt in a proper Medicament, is put between the
  <i>Dura Mater</i> and the Skull; the Hole is fill'd with small Bolsters
  steept in convenient Medicinal Liquors; and the Wound is dress'd with
  Pledgets, a Plaister, and a Kerchief. <!-- Page 213 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>But the Hole ought to be well stopt with Bolsters, because the <i>Dura
  Mater</i> is sometimes so much inflam'd, that it bursts forth; so that if
  any Excrescences arise therein, and go out of the Hole, having small
  Roots, they may be bound and cut; but if their Roots be large, they must
  be press'd close with little Bolsters steept in Spirituous Medicines.
  Here it may not be improper to observe, that the Operation of the Trepan
  ought to be perform'd more gently in Children than in adult Persons, in
  regard that their Bones are more tender, and that Oily Medicines must not
  be us'd, but Spirituous. The Exfoliation is made sometimes sooner, and
  sometimes later; but the <i>Callus</i> usually covers the opening of the
  Skull within the space of forty or fifty Days, if no ill Accident
  happens. In great Fractures, where there is no longer any connexion
  between the Bones, it is requisite to take 'em away.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Bandage of the Trepan.</i></h3>

  <p>The proper Bandage to be us'd after the Operation of the Trepan, is
  the great Kerchief, which is a large Napkin folded into two parts after
  such a manner that the side which toucheth the Head exceeds that which
  doth not touch it in the breadth of four Fingers; it is apply'd to the
  Head in the middle, whilst a Servant holds the Dressing with his Hand:
  Then the two upper ends of the Napkin being brought under Chin, the
  Surgeon takes the two lower, and draws 'em streight by the sides, so as
  that side the Napkin, which is four Fingers broader <!-- Page 214
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>{214}</span>than the
  other, may be laid upon the Forehead: Afterward the two ends of the
  Napkin are cross'd behind the Head, and fasten'd at their Extremities
  with Pins, without making any Folds, that might hurt the Part; but the
  ends of the Napkin which fall upon the Shoulders, are rais'd up to the
  Head near the lesser Corner of the Eyes; and the two ends under the Chin
  are fasten'd with Pins, or else tied in a Knot.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Fistula
Lachrymalis<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when there is a Fistulous Ulcer in the
  great Corner of the Eye, after this manner: The Patient being plac'd in a
  convenient Posture, and having his sound Eye bound up, to take away the
  sight of the Instruments; the Operator causeth the other Eye to be kept
  steady with a Bolster held with an Instrument, and makes an Incision with
  a Lancet in form of a Crescent upon the Tumour, taking care to avoid
  cutting the Eye-Lid and the little Cartilage which serves as a Pulley to
  the great Oblique Muscle. If the Bone be putrify'd with a <i>Caries</i>,
  an Actual Cautery may be apply'd thereto, using for that purpose a small
  Funnel or Tube, thro' the Canal of which the Cautery is convey'd to the
  Bone. <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>But the Bone must not be pierc'd, for it
  is exfoliated entire by reason of its smallness; and so the Hole is made
  without any Perforation.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage of the </i>Fistula
Lachrymalis<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Wound is fill'd with small dry Pledgets, and cover'd with a
  Plaister and Bolster: The Bandage is made with an Handkerchief folded
  triangular-wise, the ends of which are fasten'd behind the Head. If the
  Flesh grows too fast, it may be consum'd with the <i>Lapis
  Infernalis</i>; and if there be occasion to dilate the Wound, to
  facilitate the Exfoliation, it may be done with little pieces of Spunge
  prepar'd, and put into it. Afterward Causticks are to be us'd, to eat
  away the Callous Parts, which may be mingled with Oily Medicines, to
  weaken their Action, taking care, nevertheless, that the Eye receive no
  dammage by 'em. If the Bone be corrupted, a little <i>Euphorbium</i> may
  be apply'd; or else the small Pledgets steept in the Tincture of Myrrh
  and Aloes; then the Ulcer may be handled as all others.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Cataract<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when there is a small Body before the
  Apple of the Eye, which hinders the Sight from entring into it; but it is
  undertaken only in Blew, Green, and Pearl-colour'd Cataracts, or in those
  that are of the Colour of polish'd Steel; and not in Yellow, Black, or
  Lead-colour'd. To know whether the Cataract be fit to be couch'd, the
  Patient's Eye must be rubb'd; so that if the Cataract remains unmoveable,
  it is mature enough; but if it changeth its place, it is requisite to
  wait till it become more solid. The Spring and Autumn are the most proper
  Seasons for performing the Operation.</p>

  <p>To this purpose the Patient being set down with his Eyes turn'd toward
  the Light, and having his sound Eye bound up, the Surgeon must likewise
  sit on a higher Seat, whilst the Patient's Head is held by a Servant; and
  his Eye being turn'd toward his Nose, is kept steady with a <i>Speculum
  Oculi</i>, which is a little Iron-Instrument made like a Spoon, pierc'd
  in the middle, so that the Ball of the Eye may be let thro' this Hole:
  Then the Surgeon taking <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'a a'."
  >a</span> Steel-Needle either round or flat, accordingly as he shall
  judge convenient, perforates the Conjunctive at the end of the Corneous
  Tunicle, on the side of the little Corner of the <!-- Page 217 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>{217}</span>Eye, and boldly thrusts
  his Needle into the middle of the Cataract, which he at first pusheth
  upward, to loosen it with the Point of the Needle; and then downward,
  holding it for some time with his Needle below the Apple of the Eye. If
  it ascend again after it is let go, it must be depress'd a second time;
  but the Operation is finish'd when it remains in the same place whereto
  it was thrust; neither is the Needle to be remov'd till this be done, and
  the Cataract entirely couch'd. In taking out the Needle, the Eye-Lid must
  be pull'd down, and press'd a little over the Eye.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage,</i></h3>

  <p>Is to cause both the Patient's Eyes to be clos'd and bound up; then he
  must be oblig'd to keep his Bed during seven or eight Days, and some
  Defensative is to be laid upon the sore Eye, to hinder the
  Inflammation.</p>

  <p>M. <i>Dupré</i>, Surgeon to the Hospital of <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> at
  <i>Paris</i>, a Person well vers'd in these kinds of Operations, hath
  observ'd, that after the same manner as Cataracts were form'd in a very
  little space of time in perfect Maturity; it happen'd also very often,
  that the Cataracts which were suppos'd to have got up again, were not the
  very same with those that were couch'd, but rather a new <i>Pellicula</i>
  or little Skin, which sometimes hath its Origine in the top of the
  <i>Uveous</i> Tunicle, and is caus'd only by a very considerable
  Relaxation of the Excretory Vessels from the Sources of the Aqueous
  Humour which in filtrating permits the running <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>of many heterogeneous
  Parts, the Encrease of which produceth a new Cataract.</p>

<h3><i>Of other Operations in the Eyes.</i></h3>

  <p>Sometimes a sort of purulent Matter is gather'd together under the
  Corneous Tunicle; so that to draw it out, the Eye must be fixt in a
  Posture with the <i>Speculum Oculi</i>, and after a small Incision made
  therein with a fine Lancet, is to be press'd a little, to let out the
  Matter; but if it be too thick, it may be drawn forth by sucking gently
  with a small Tube or Pipe, having a little Vial in the middle, into which
  the Matter will fall as it is suck'd out.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a small Tumour ariseth in the Eye, which being ty'd at its
  Root with a Slip-Knot, to streighten it from time to time, will at length
  be dissolv'd: But if the Tumour lie in the Hole of the Apple of the Eye,
  this Operation must not be admitted, lest the Scar shou'd hinder the
  Passage of the Light. Sometimes also a somewhat hard Membrane, call'd
  <i>Unguis</i>, appears in the great corner of the eye, which when it
  sticks thereto, may be cut off by binding it; this is done with a Needle
  and Thread, which is pass'd thro' the Membrane, and afterward ty'd.</p>

  <p>If the Eye-Lids are glu'd together, a crooked Needle without a Point
  may be threaded, and pass'd underneath 'em; then the ends of the Thread
  may be drawn, to lift up the Eye-Lids, and they may be separated with a
  Lancet.</p>

<p><!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span></p>

  <p>If the Hairs of the Eye-Lids or Eye-Brows offend the Eye, they must be
  pull'd out with a Pair of Tweezers or Nippers; and when any small, hard,
  and transparent Tumours arise in the Eye-Lids, they are to be open'd, to
  let out the corrupt Matter.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Polypus<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is necessary, when there are any Excrescences of Flesh
  in the Nostrils, which, nevertheless, when they are livid, stinking,
  hard, painful, and sticking very close, must not be tamper'd with,
  because they are Cancers. But if they are whitish, red, hanging, and free
  from Pain, the Cure may be undertaken after this manner: Take hold of the
  <i>Polypus</i> with a Pair of <i>Forceps</i>, as near its Root as is
  possible, and turn 'em first on one side, and then on another, till it be
  pull'd off. If the <i>Polypus</i> descends into the Throat, it may be
  drawn thro' the Mouth with crooked <i>Forceps</i>; and if an Hæmorrhage
  shou'd happen after the Operation, it may be stopt by thrusting up into
  the Nostrils certain Tents soakt in some Styptick Liquor; or else by
  Syringing with the same Liquor.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Hare-Lip<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when the Upper-Lip is cleft; but if there
  be a great loss of Substance, it must not be undertaken; neither ought it
  to be practis'd upon old nor scorbutick Persons, nor upon young Children,
  by reason that their continual Crying wou'd hinder the re-union. But if
  any are desirous that it shou'd be done to these last, they are to be
  kept from taking any rest for a long time, to the end that they may fall
  a-sleep after the Operation, which is thus effected:</p>

  <p>If the Lip sticks to the Gums, it is to be separated with an
  Incision-Knife, without hurting 'em; then the Hare-Lip must be cut a
  little about the edges with Sizzers, that it may more easily re-unite,
  the edges being held for that purpose with a Pair of Pincers, whilst the
  Servant who supports the Patient's Head, presseth his Cheeks before, to
  draw together the sides of the Hare-Lip: Whereupon the Operator passeth a
  Needle with wax'd Thread, into the two sides of the Wound, from the
  outside to the inside at a Thread's distance from each. But care must be
  had that the two Lips of the Hare-Lip be well adjusted, and very even;
  the Thread being twisted round the Needle by crossing it above.</p>

<p><!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>After the Lips are wash'd with warm Wine, the Points of the Needles
  must be cut off, small Bolsters being laid under their ends; then the
  Wound is to be dress'd with a little Pledget cover'd with some proper
  Balsam, putting at the same time under the Gum a Linnen Rag steep'd in
  some desiccative Liquor, lest the Lip shou'd stick to the Gum, if it be
  necessary to keep 'em a-part. Lastly, upon the whole is to be laid an
  agglutinative Plaister, supported with the uniting Bandage, which is a
  small Band perforated in the middle; it is laid behind the Head, and
  afterward drawn forward, one of its ends being let into the Hole which
  lies upon the Sore: Then the two ends of the Band are turn'd behind the
  Head upon the same Folds where they are fasten'd, sticking therein a
  certain Number of Pins, proportionably to the length of the Wound.</p>

  <p>The Patient must be dress'd three Days after; and it is requisite at
  the first time only to untwist half the Needle, loosening the middle
  Thread if there be three; to which purpose a Servant is to thrust the
  Cheeks somewhat forward. On the eighth Day the middle Needle may be taken
  off, if it be a young Infant; nevertheless the Needles must not be
  remov'd till it appears that the sides are well join'd; neither must they
  be left too long, because the Holes wou'd scarce be brought to close.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Bronchotomy<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation becomes necessary, when the Inflammation that happens

  manner:</p>

  <p>The Wind-Pipe is open'd between the third and fourth Ring, above the
  Muscle <i>Cricoides</i>, or else in the middle of the Wind-Pipe; but in
  separating the Muscles call'd <i>Sternohyodei</i>, care must be had to
  avoid cutting the recurrent Nerves, lest the Voice shou'd be lost; as
  also the Glandules nam'd <i>Thyroides</i>. The Space between the Rings is
  to be open'd with a streight Lancet, kept steady with a little Band, and
  a transverse Incision is to be made between 'em: Before the Lancet is
  taken out, a Stilet is put into the Opening, thro' which passeth a little
  Pipe, short, flat, and somewhat crooked at the end, which must not be
  thrust in too far, for fear of exciting a Cough. This Pipe hath two small
  Rings for the fastening of Ribbans, which are ty'd round about the Neck;
  and it must be left in the Wound till the Symptoms cease. Afterward it is
  taken away, and the Wound is dress'd, the Lips of it being drawn together
  again with the uniting Bandage, which hath been already describ'd.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of a Cancer in the
Breast.</i></h3>

  <p>The Cancer at first is not so big as a Pea, being a small, hard,
  blackish Swelling, sometimes livid, and very troublesome by reason of its
  Prickings; but when it is encreas'd, the Tumour appears hard,
  Lead-colour'd, and livid, causing in the beginning a Pain that may be
  pretty well endur'd, but in the increase it grows intolerable, and the
  Stink is extremely noisome. When it is ready to Ulcerate, the Heat is
  vehement, with a pricking Pulsation; and the Veins round about are
  turgid, being <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>{224}</span>fill'd with black Blood, and extended as
  it were the Feet of a Crab or Crey-Fish, till Death happen. When this
  Tumour is not ulcerated, it is call'd an <i>Occult Cancer</i>; and an
  <i>Apparent</i> one when it breaks forth into an open Ulcer.</p>

  <p>To palliate an Occult Cancer, and prevent its Ulceration, a Cataplasm
  or Pultis of Hemlock very fresh may be apply'd to the Part. All the kinds
  of Succory, the Decoction of <i>Solanum</i> or Night-shade; the Juices of
  these Plants, as also those of Scabious, <i>Geranium</i> or Stork-Bill,
  <i>Herniaria</i> or Rupture-Wort, Plantain, <i>&amp;c.</i> are very good
  in the beginning. River-Crabs pounded in a Leaden-Mortar, and their Juice
  beaten in a like Mortar, are an excellent Remedy; as also are Humane
  Excrements or Urine destill'd, and laid upon the Occult Cancer: Or
  else,</p>

  <p>Take an Ounce of calcin'd Lead, two Ounces of Oil of Roses, and six
  Drams of Saffron; let the whole Composition be beaten in a Mortar with a
  Leaden Pestle, and apply'd. The Amalgama of <i>Mercury</i> with
  <i>Saturn</i> is likewise a very efficacious Remedy.</p>

  <p>In the mean while the Patient may be purg'd with black Hellebore and
  <i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>, taking also inwardly from one Scruple to half a
  Dram of the Powder of Adders, given to drink, with half the quantity of
  Crab's-Eyes: But very great care must be taken to avoid the Application
  of Maturatives or Emollients, which wou'd certainly bring the Tumour to
  Ulceration. <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span></p>

  <p>When the Cancer is already ulcerated, the Spirit of Chimney-Soot may
  be us'd with good Success; and the Oil of Sea-Crabs pour'd scalding hot
  into the Ulcer, is an excellent Remedy. But if it be judg'd expedient
  entirely to extirpate the Cancer, it may be done thus:</p>

  <p>The sick Patient being laid in Bed, the Surgeon takes the Arm on the
  side of the Cancer, and lifts it upward and backward, to give more room
  to the Tumour; then having pass'd a Needle with a very strong Thread
  thro' the bottom of the Breast, he cuts the Thread to take away the
  Needle, and passeth the Needle again into the Breast, to cause the
  Threads to cross one another. Afterward these four ends of the Threads
  are ty'd together, to make a kind of Handle to take off the Tumour, which
  is cut quite round to the Ribs with a very sharp Rasor. The Cutting is
  usually begun in the lower Part to end in the Vessels near the Arm-Pit,
  where a small Piece of Flesh is left, to stop the Blood with greater
  Facility: Then having laid a Piece of Vitriol upon the Vessels, or
  Bolsters soakt in styptick Water; the sides of the Breast are to be
  press'd with the Hand, to let out the Blood and Humours; and an Actual
  Cautery is to be lightly apply'd thereto.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing.</i></h3>

  <p>The Wound is to be dress'd with Pledgets strew'd with Astringent
  Powders, a Plaister, a Bolster, a Napkin round the Brest, and a Scapulary
  to support the whole Bandage. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span></p>

  <p>But instead of passing Threads cross-wise, to form a Handle, with
  which the Breast may be taken off, it wou'd be more expedient to make use
  of a sort of <i>Forceps</i> turn'd at both ends in form of a Crescent,
  after such a manner that those ends may fall one upon another when the
  <i>Forceps</i> are shut. Thus the Surgeon may lay hold on the Breast with
  these <i>Forceps</i>, and draw it off, after having cut it at one single
  Stroak with a very flat, crooked, and sharp Knife. Neither is it
  convenient to apply the Actual Cautery to stop the Hæmorrhage, because it
  is apt to break forth again anew, when the Escar is fall'n off,</p>

  <p>When the Tumour is not as yet ulcerated, a Crucial Incision may be
  made in the Skin, without penetrating into the Glandulous Bodies; then
  the four Pieces of the Glandules being separated, the Cancerous Tumour
  may be held with the <i>Forceps</i>, and afterward cut off. If there be
  any Vessels swell'd, they may be bound before the Tumour is taken away;
  but if the Tumour sticks close to the Ribs, the Operation is not usually
  undertaken.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> IX.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Empyema<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when it may be reasonably concluded that
  some corrupt Matter is lodg'd in the Breast, which may be perceiv'd by
  the weight that the Patient feels in fetching his Breath; being also
  sensible of the floating of the Matter when he turns himself from one
  side to another.</p>

  <p>If the Tumour appears on the outside, the Abcess may be open'd between
  the Ribs; but if no external Signs are discern'd, the Surgeon may choose
  a more convenient place to make the Opening. Thus when the Patient is set
  upon his Bed, and conveniently supported, the Opening is to be made
  between the second and third of the Spurious Ribs, within four Fingers
  breadth of the Spine, and the lower Corner of the <i>Omoplata</i>; to
  this purpose the Skin is to be taken up a-cross, to cut it in its length,
  the Surgeon holding it on one side, and the Assistant on the other. The
  Incision is made with a streight Knife two or three Fingers breadth long,
  and the Fibres of the great Dorsal-Muscle are cut a-cross, that they may
  not stop the Opening. Then the Surgeon puts the Fore-Finger of his
  Left-hand into the Incision, to remove the Fibres, and divides the
  Intercostal Muscles, guiding the Point of the Knife with his Finger to
  pierce the <i>Pleuron</i>, for fear of wounding <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>the Lungs, which
  sometimes adhere thereto, the Opening being thus finish'd, if the Matter
  runs well, it must be taken out; but if not, the Fore-Finger must be put
  into the Wound, to disjoyn those Parts of the Lungs that stick to the
  <i>Pleuron</i>.</p>

  <p>To let out the Matter, the Patient must be oblig'd to lean on one
  side, stopping his Mouth and Nose, and puffing up his Cheeks, as if he
  were to blow vehemently; then if Blood appears, a greater quantity of it
  may be taken away than if it were Matter, in regard that a Flux of Matter
  weakens more than that of Blood. It is also worth the while to observe,
  that in making the Incision, the Intercostal Muscles ought to be cut
  a-cross, that the side of the Ribs may not be laid bare, by which means
  the Wound will not so soon become Fistulous.</p>

  <p>If it be judg'd that purulent Matter is contain'd in both sides of the
  Breast, it is requisite that the Operation be done on each side; it being
  well known that the Breast is divided into two Parts by the
  <i>Mediastinum</i>: But in this case the two Holes made by the Incision
  must not be left open at the same time, for fear of suffocating the
  Patient.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>The Wound is dress'd with a Tent of Lint arm'd with Balsam, being
  soft, and blunt at the end, which enters only between the Ribs, for fear
  of hurting the Lungs; but a good Pledget of Lint is more convenient than
  a Linnen <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span>Tent, however a Thread must be ty'd to the
  Pledget or Tent, lest it shou'd fall into the Breast; and Bolsters are to
  be put into the Wound; as also a Plaister or Band over the whole. This
  Dressing is to be <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'kepc'."
  >kept</span> close with a Napkin fasten'd round the Breast with Pins, and
  supported by a Scapulary, which is a sort of Band, the breadth of which
  is equal to that of six Fingers, having a Hole in the middle to let in
  the Head: One of its ends falls behind and the other before; and they are
  both fasten'd to the Napkin. Thus the Patient is laid in Bed, and set
  half upright. If the Lungs hinder the running out of the Matter, a Pipe
  is us'd, and the Wound afterward dress'd according to Art.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Paracentesis<i> of
the Lower-Belly.</i></h3>

  <p>This Manual Operation is sometimes necessary in a Dropsie, when Watry
  Humours are contain'd in the Cavity of the Belly, or else between the
  Teguments. The Disease is manifest by the great Swelling; and the
  Operation is perform'd with a Cane, or a Pipe made of Silver or Steel,
  with a sharp Stilet at the end; altho' the Ancients were wont to do it
  with a Lancet. The Patient being supported, sitting on a Bed, or in a
  great Elbow-Chair, to the end that the Water may run downward, <!-- Page
  230 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>a Servant
  must press the Belly with his Hands, that the Tumour may be extended,
  whilst the Surgeon perforates it three or four Fingers breadth below the
  Navel, and makes the Puncture on the side, to avoid the White-Line; but
  before the Opening is made, it is expedient that the Skin be a little
  lifted up. The pointed Stilet being accompany'd with its Pipe, remains in
  the Part after the Puncture; but it is remov'd to let out the Water; and
  a convenient quantity of it is taken away, accordingly as the Strength of
  the Patient will admit. The Stilet makes so small an Opening, that it is
  not to be fear'd lest the Water shou'd run out, which might happen in
  making use of the Lancet, because there wou'd be occasion for a thicker
  Pipe. When a new Puncture is requisite, it must be begun beneath the
  former; but if the Waters cause the Navel to stand out, the Opening may
  be made therein, without seeking for any other place.</p>

<h3><i>The Bandage and Dressing</i></h3>

  <p>Are prepar'd with a large four-double Bolster kept close with a Napkin
  folded into three or four Folds, which is in like manner supported by the
  Scapulary.</p>

<h3><i>The Operation of the </i>Paracentesis<i> of the
</i>Scrotum</h3>

  <p>Is undertaken when those Parts are full of Water, after this manner:
  Assoon as the Patient is plac'd in a convenient Posture, either <!-- Page
  231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>standing
  or sitting, the Operator lays hold on the <i>Scrotum</i> with one Hand,
  presseth it a little to render the Tumour hard, and makes a Puncture, as
  in the <i>Paracentesis</i> of the <i>Abdomen</i>. In an <i>Hydrocele</i>
  that happens to young Infants, the Opening may be made with a Lancet, to
  take away all the Water at once: But in Men, especially when there is a
  great quantity thereof, it is more expedient to do it with the
  sharp-pointed Pipe; but the Testicles are to be drawn back, for fear of
  wounding 'em with the Point of the Instrument.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Hydrocele</i> be apparently <i>Encysted</i>, the Membrane
  containing the Water is to be consum'd with Causticks, which is done by
  laying a Cautery in the place where the Incision shou'd be made, and
  afterward opening the Escar with a Lancet.</p>

  <p>When the Puncture is made, it ought to be done in the upper-part of
  the <i>Scrotum</i>, because it is less painful than the lower, and less
  subject to Inflammation.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XI.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Gastroraphy<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is usually perform'd when there is a Wound in the Belly
  so wide as to let out the Entrails. If there be a considerable Wound in
  the Intestine, it may be sow'd up with the Glover's Stitch, the manner of
  making which we have before explain'd. If <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>the <i>Omentum</i> or
  Caul be mortify'd, the corrupted Part must be cut off; to which purpose
  it is requisite to take a Needle with waxed Thread, and to pass it into
  the sound Part a-cross the Caul, without pricking the Vessels. Then the
  Caul being ty'd on both sides with each of the Threads that have been
  pass'd double, may be cut an Inch below the Ligature, and the Threads
  will go thro' the Wound, so as to be taken away after the Suppuration.
  Afterward the Intestines are to be put up again into the Belly, by
  thrusting 'em alternately with the end of the Fingers. But if they cannot
  be restor'd to their proper Place without much difficulty, Spirituous
  Fomentations may be made with an handful of the Flowers of Camomile and
  Melilot, an Ounce of Anise, with as much Fennel and Cummin-Seeds; half an
  Ounce of Cloves and Nutmegs: Let the whole Mass be boil'd in Milk, adding
  an Ounce of Camphirated Spirit of Wine, and two Drams of <i>Saccharum
  Saturni</i>, with two Scruples of Oil of Anise, and bathe the Entrails
  with this Fomentation very hot. Otherwise,</p>

  <p>Apply Animals cut open alive; or else boil Skeins of raw Thread in
  Milk, and foment 'em with this Decoction in like manner very hot.</p>

  <p>Before the Suture of Stitching of the Intestines is made, it is
  expedient to foment 'em with Spirit of Wine, in which a little Camphire
  hath been dissolv'd: But if they be mortify'd, they must not be sown up
  again, but fomented with Spirituous Liquors. No Clysters are to be given
  to the Patient, for fear <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>causing the Intestine to swell; but a
  Suppository may be apply'd: Or else he may make use of a Laxative
  Diet-Drink, if it be necessary to open his Body: He ought also to be very
  temperate and abstemious during the Cure, so as to take no other
  Sustenance than Broths and Gellies.</p>

  <p>If the Intestines cannot be put up again, the Wound is to be dilated,
  avoiding the White-Line, and that too at the bottom rather than at the
  Top, if it be above. To this purpose the Intestines are to be rank'd
  along the side of the Wound, and a Bolster is to be laid upon 'em dipt in
  warm Wine, which may be held by some Assistant. Then the Surgeon
  introduceth a channel'd Probe into the Belly, and takes a great deal of
  care to fix the Intestine between the Probe and the <i>Peritonæum</i>,
  which may be effected by drawing out the Intestine a little; then holding
  the Probe with his Left-hand, to fit a crooked Incision-Knife in its
  chanelling, he cuts the Teguments equally both on the outside and within,
  and thrusts back the Entrails alternately into the Wound with his
  Fore-Finger.</p>

  <p>The Stitch must be intermitted, being made with two crooked Needles
  threaded at each end with the same Thread. The Surgeon having at first
  put the Fore-Finger of his Left-Hand into the Belly, to retain the
  <i>Peritonæum</i>, Muscles, and Skin on the side of the Wound, passeth
  the Needle with his other Hand into the Belly, the Point of which is
  guided with the Fore-Finger, and penetrates very far: Then he likewise
  passeth the other <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page234"></a>{234}</span>Needle thro' the other Lip of the Wound
  into the Belly, observing the same thing as in the former, and without
  taking his Fingers off from the Belly. If there are many Points or
  Stitches to be made, they may be done after the same manner, without
  removing the Fingers from the Part, whilst a Servant draws together the
  Lips of the Wound, and ties the Knots. Afterward the Wound may be
  dress'd, and the Preparatives or Dressings kept close to the Part with
  the Napkin and Scapulary. But the Patient must be oblig'd to lie on his
  Belly for some Days successively, to cicatrize the Wound thereof, or that
  of the Entrails.</p>

  <p>If the Intestine were entirely cut, it wou'd be requisite to sow it up
  round about the Wound, after such a manner that some part of it may
  always remain open; for if the Patient shou'd recover, his Excrements
  might be voided thro' the Wound; of which Accident we have an Example in
  a Soldier belonging to the Hospital <i>Des Invalides</i> at <i>Paris</i>,
  who liv'd a long time in this Condition.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Exomphalus<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is necessary when the Intestines or Entrails have made
  a kind of Rupture in the Navel, and may be perform'd thus: When the
  Patient is laid upon his Back, an Incision is to be made on the Tumour to
  <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page235"></a>{235}</span>the Fat, by griping the Skin, if it be
  possible, or else it may be done without taking it up. Then the Membranes
  are to be divided with a Fleam to lay open the <i>Peritonæum</i>, for
  fear of cutting the Intestine; and as soon as the <i>Peritonæum</i>
  appears, it may be drawn upward with the Nails, in order to make a small
  Opening therein with some cutting Instrument: Whereupon the Surgeon
  having put the Fore-Finger of his Left-Hand into the Belly to guide the
  Point of the Sizzers, with which the Incision is enlarg'd, restores the
  Intestine to its proper Place, and loosens the Caul if it stick to the
  Tumour: But if the Entrails are fasten'd to the Caul, it is requisite to
  separate 'em by cutting a little of the Caul, rather than to touch the
  Intestine; which last being reduc'd, a Servant may press the Belly on the
  side of the Wound; so that if a Mass of Flesh be found in the Caul, which
  hath been form'd by the sticking of the Caul to the Muscles and
  <i>Peritonæum</i>, this Fleshy Mass must be entirely loosen'd, and then a
  Ligature may be made to take it away, with some part of the Caul, as we
  have already shewn in the <i>Gastroraphy</i>. Afterward the Stitch is to
  be made, as in that Operation, and the Wound must be dress'd, observing
  the same Precautions. The Dressing is to be supported in like manner with
  the Napkin and Scapulary.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the</i> Bubonocele,
<i>and of the compleat Rupture.</i></h3>

  <p>When the Intestinal Parts are fall'n into the Groin or the
  <i>Scrotum</i>, the Operation of the <i>Bubonocele</i> may be
  conveniently perform'd; to which purpose the Patient is to be laid upon
  his Back, with his Buttocks somewhat high; then the Skin being grip'd
  a-cross the Tumour, the Surgeon holds it on one side, and the Assistant
  on the other, till he makes an Incision, following the Folds or Wrinkles
  of the Groin; when the Fat appears, it is requisite to tear off either
  with a Fleam or even with the Nails, every thing that lies in the way,
  till the Intestine be laid open, which must be drawn out a little, to see
  if it do not cleave to the Rings of the Muscles. The Intestine must be
  gently handl'd, to dissolve the Excrements; and those Parts must be
  afterward put up again into the Belly (if it be possible) with the two
  Fore-Fingers, thrusting 'em alternatively; but if they cannot be reduc'd,
  the Wound is to be dilated upward, by introducing a channell'd Probe into
  the Belly, to let the Sizzers into its Channelling. If the Probe cannot
  enter, the Intestine must be taken out a little, laying a Finger upon it
  near the Ring, and making a small Scarification in the Ring, with a
  streight Incision-Knife guided with the <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>{237}</span>Finger, to let in the
  Probe, into which may be put a crooked Knife, to cut the Ring; that is to
  say, to dilate the Wound on the inside; but care must be had to avoid
  penetrating too far, for fear of dividing a Branch of Arteries; and then
  the Parts may be put up into the Belly. If the Caul had caus'd the
  Rupture, it wou'd be requisite to bind it, and to cut off whatsoever is
  corrupted, scarifying the Ring on the inside, <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'to to'.">to</span> make a good Cicatrice or
  Scar.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>The Dressing may be prepar'd with a Linnen-Tent, soft and blunt, of a
  sufficient thickness and length, to hinder the Intestines from re-entring
  into the Rings by their Impulsion, a Thread being ty'd thereto, to draw
  it out as occasion serves. Then Pledgets are to be put into the Wound,
  after they have been dipt in a good Digestive, such as Turpentine with
  the Yolk of an Egg, applying at the same time a Plaister, a Bolster of a
  Triangular Figure, and the Bandage call'd <i>Spica</i>, which is made
  much after the same manner as that which is us'd in the Fracture of the
  Clavicle.</p>

<h3><i>Of the compleat </i>Hernia<i> or Rupture.</i></h3>

  <p>It happens when the Intestinal Parts fall into the <i>Scrotum</i> in
  Men, or into the bottom of the Lips of the <i>Matrix</i> in Women. To
  perform this Operation, the Patient must be laid upon his Back, as in the
  <i>Bubonocele</i>, and the Incision carry'd on after the same manner;
  which is to <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>be made in the <i>Scrotum</i>, tearing off
  the Membranes to the Intestine. Then a Search will be requisite, to
  observe whether any parts stick to the Testicle; if the Caul doth so, it
  must be taken off, leaving a little Piece on the Testicle; but if it be
  the Intestine, so that those Parts cannot be separated without hurting
  one of 'em, it is more expedient to impair the Testicle than the
  Intestine. If the Caul be corrupted, it must be cut to the sound Part,
  and the Wound is to be dress'd with Pledgets, Bolsters, and the Bandage
  <i>Spica</i>; as in the <i>Bubonocele</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Castration<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Mortification or the <i>Sarcocele</i> of the Testicles, gives
  occasion to this Operation; to perform which, the Patient must be laid
  upon his Back, with his Buttocks higher than his Head, his Legs being
  kept open, and the Skin of the <i>Scrotum</i> taken up, one end of which
  is to be held by a Servant, and the other by the Surgeon, who having made
  a longitudinal Incision therein, or from the top to the bottom, slips off
  the Flesh of the <i>Dartos</i> which covers the Testicle, binds up the
  Vessels that lie between the Rings and the Tumour, and cuts 'em off a
  Fingers breadth beneath the Ligature: But care must be taken to avoid
  tying the Spermatick Vessels too hard, for fear of a Convulsion, and <!--
  Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>to
  let one end of the Thread pass without the Wound. If an Excrescence of
  Flesh stick to the Testicle, and it be moveable or loose, it is requisite
  to take it off neatly, leaving a small Piece of it on the Testicle; and
  if any considerable Vessels appear in the Tumour, they must be bound
  before they are cut.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>The Dressing is made with Pledgets and Bolsters laid upon the
  <i>Scrotum</i>; and the proper Bandage is the <i>Suspensor</i> of the
  <i>Scrotum</i>, which hath four Heads or Ends, of which the upper serve
  as a Cincture or Girdle; and the lower passing between the Thighs, and
  fasten'd behind to the Cincture.</p>

  <p>There is also another Bandage of the <i>Scrotum</i>, having in like
  manner four Heads, of which the upper constitute the Cincture; but it is
  slit at the bottom, and hath no Seams; the lower Heads crossing one
  another, to pass between the Thighs, and to be join'd to the Cincture.
  Both these sorts of Bandages have a Hole to give Passage to the Yard.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the Stone in the</i>
Ureter.</h3>

  <p>If the Stone be stopt at the <i>Sphincter</i> of the Bladder, it ought
  to be thrust back with a Probe: If it stick at the end of the
  <i>Glans</i>, it may be press'd to let it out; and if it cannot come
  forth, a small Incision may be made in the opening of the <i>Glans</i> on
  its side.</p>

  <p>But if the Stone be remote from the <i>Glans</i>, it is requisite to
  make an Incision into the <i>Ureter</i>; to which purpose, the Surgeon
  having caus'd the Skin to be drawn upward, holds the Yard between two
  Fingers, making a Longitudinal Incision on its side upon the Stone, which
  must be prest between the Fingers to cause it to fly out; or else it may
  be taken out with an <i>Extractor</i>. Then if the Incision were very
  small, the Skin needs only to be let go, and it will heal of it self; but
  if it were large, a small Leaden Pipe is to be put into the
  <i>Ureter</i>, lest it shou'd be altogether clos'd up by the Scar: It is
  also expedient to anoint the Pipe with some Desiccative Medicine, and to
  dress the Wound with Balsam. Afterward a little Linnen-Bag or Case is to
  be made, in which the Yard is to be put, to keep on the Dressing; but it
  must be pierc'd at the end, for the convenience of making Water, having
  two Bands at the other end, which are ty'd round about the Waste.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Lithotomy<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is undertaken when it is certainly known that there is
  a Stone in the Bladder; to be assur'd of which, it may not be improper to
  introduce a Finger into the <i>Anus</i> near the <i>Os Pubis</i>, by
  which means the Stone is sometimes felt, if there be any: The Finger is
  likewise usually put into the <i>Anus</i> of young Virgins, and into the
  <i>Vagina Uteri</i> of Women, for the same purpose. But it is more
  expedient to make use of the Probe, anointed with Grease, after this
  manner: The Patient being laid on his Back, the Operator holds the Yard
  streight upward, the <i>Glans</i> lying open between his Thumb and
  Fore-finger; then holding the Probe with his Right-hand on the side of
  the Rings, he guides it into the Yard, and when it is enter'd, turns the
  Handle toward the <i>Pubes</i>, drawing out the Yard a little, to the end
  that the Canal of the <i>Ureter</i> may lie streight. If it be perceiv'd
  that the Probe hath not as yet pass'd into the Bladder, a Finger is to be
  put into the <i>Anus</i>, to conduct it thither. Afterward in order to
  know whether a Stone be lodg'd in the Bladder, the Probe ought to be
  shaken a little therein, first on the Right-side, and then on the Left;
  and if a small Noise be heard, it may be concluded for certain that there
  is a Stone: But if it be judg'd that the <!-- Page 242 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span>Stone swims in the
  Bladder, so that it cannot be felt, the Patient must be oblig'd to make
  Water with a hollow Probe.</p>

  <p>Another manner of searching may be practis'd thus: Let the Yard be
  rais'd upward, inclining a little to the side of the Belly; let the Rings
  of the Probe be turn'd upon the Belly, and the end on the side of the
  <i>Anus</i>; and then let this Instrument be introduc'd, shaking it a
  little on both sides, to discover the Stone.</p>

  <p>In order to perform the Operation of Lithotomy, the Patient must be
  laid along upon a Table of a convenient height, so as that the Surgeon
  may go about his Work standing; the Patient's Back must also lean upon
  the Back of a Chair laid down, and trimm'd with Linnen-Cloth, lest it
  shou'd hurt his Body; his Legs must be kept asunder, and the Soles of his
  Feet on the sides of the Table, whilst a Man gets up behind him to hold
  his Shoulders: His Arms and Legs must be also bound with Straps or Bands.
  Then a channell'd Probe being put up into the Bladder, a Servant standing
  upon the Table on the side of the Chair, holds the Back of the Instrument
  between his two Fore-fingers on that Part of the <i>Perinæum</i> where
  the Incision ought to be begun, which is to be made between his Fingers
  with a sharp Knife that cuts on both sides: The Incision may be three or
  four Fingers breadth on the left side of the <i>Raphe</i> or Suture: But
  in Children its length must not exceed two Fingers breadth. If the
  Incision were too little to give Passage to the Stone, it wou'd be more
  expedient to enlarge it than to stretch the Wound <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>with the Dilatators.
  When the Convex Part where the channelling of the Probe lies, shall be
  well laid open, the Conductors may be slipt into the same Channelling,
  between which the <i>Forceps</i> is to be put, having before taken away
  the Probe. Some Operators make use of a <i>Gorgeret</i> or Introductor to
  that purpose, conveying the end of it into the Chanelling of the Probe;
  which is remov'd to introduce the <i>Forceps</i> into the Bladder: And as
  soon as they are fixt therein, the Conductors or <i>Gorgeret</i> must be
  likewise taken out. Afterward search being made for the Stone, it must be
  held fast, and drawn out of the Bladder: But if the Stone be long, and
  the Operator hath got hold thereof by the two Ends, he must endeavour to
  lay hold on it again by the Middle, to avoid the great scattering which
  wou'd happen in the Passage. The Stones are also sometimes so large, that
  there is an absolute necessity of leaving 'em in the Bladder. Again, if
  the Stone sticks very close to the Bladder, the Extraction ought to be
  deferr'd for some time; and perhaps it may be loosen'd in the
  Suppuration. Lastly, when the Stone hath been taken out, an Extractor is
  usually introduc'd into the Bladder, to remove the Gravel, Fragments, and
  Clots of Blood.</p>

  <p>After the Operation, the Patient is carry'd to his Bed, having before
  cover'd the Wound with a good Bolster; and if an Hæmorrhage happens, it
  is to be stopt with Astringents. A Tent must also be put into the Wound,
  when it is suspected that some Stone or Gravel may as yet remain therein:
  But if it evidently appears that <!-- Page 244 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>there is none, the
  Wound may be dress'd with Pledgets, a Plaister, and a Bolster, of a
  Figure convenient for the Part. The Dressing may be staid with a Sling
  supported by a Scapulary; or else the Bandage of the double T. may be
  us'd, the manner of the Application of which we have shewn elsewhere. The
  Patient's Thighs must be drawn close to one another, and ty'd with a
  small Band, lest they shou'd be set asunder again.</p>

  <p>The Operation of Lithotomy in Women is usually perform'd by the lesser
  Preparative, which is done by putting the Fore-finger and Middle-finger
  into the <i>Vagina Uteri</i>, or into the <i>Rectum</i> in young Virgins,
  to draw the Stone to the Neck of the Bladder, and keep it steady, so that
  it may be taken out with a Hook, or other Instrument.</p>

  <p>This Operation may also be effected in Women, almost in the same
  manner as in Men; for after having caus'd the Female Patient to be set in
  the same Posture or Situation as the Men are usually plac'd, according to
  the preceeding Description, the Conductors may be convey'd into the
  <i>Ureter</i>, to let in the <i>Forceps</i> between 'em, with which the
  Stone may be drawn out: But if it be too thick, a small Incision is to be
  made in the Right and Left side of the <i>Ureter</i>.</p>

  <p>The lesser Preparative was formerly us'd in the Lithotomy of Men,
  after this manner: The Finger was put into the <i>Anus</i>, to draw the
  Stone toward the <i>Perinæum</i>; then an Incision was made upon the
  Stone on the side of the Suture, and it was taken out with an
  Instrument.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the Puncture of the
</i>Perinæum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is necessary in a Suppression of Urine, where the
  Inflammation is so great, that the Probe cannot be introduc'd. Then an
  Incision is to be made with the Knife or Lancet, in the same Place where
  it is done in Lithotomy; and a small Tube or Pipe is to be put in the
  Bladder, till the Inflammation be remov'd.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XVIII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Fistula in Ano<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Fistula's are callous Ulcers: If one of these happen in the Fundament,
  and is open on the outside, it may be cur'd thus: After the Patient hath
  been laid upon his Belly on the side of a Bed, with his Legs asunder, the
  Surgeon makes a small Incision with his Knife in the Orifice of the
  <i>Fistula</i>, in order to pass therein another small crooked
  Incision-Knife, at the end of which is a Pointed Stilet with a little
  Silver Head which covers it, to the end that it may enter without causing
  Pain. When the Surgeon hath convey'd his Knife into the <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span><i>Fistula</i>, having the Fore-finger of
  his Left-hand in the <i>Anus</i> or Fundament, he pulls off its Head,
  holding the Handle with one Hand, and the Stilet that pierceth the
  <i>Anus</i> with the other; and at last draws out the Instrument to cut
  the <i>Fistula</i> entirely at one Stroke.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Fistula</i> hath an Opening into the Intestine, an Incision
  is to be made on the outside at the Bottom thereof, to open it in the
  Place where a small Tumour or Inflammation usually appears, or else in
  the Place where the Patient feels a Pain when it is touch'd. If the
  Tumour be remote from the <i>Anus</i>, it may be open'd with the
  Potential Cautery, to avoid a greater Inconvenience. After having thus
  laid open the very bottom, the little Incision-Knife and Stilet, with its
  Head, is to be pass'd therein, the end of the Stilet is to be drawn thro'
  the <i>Anus</i>, and the Flesh is to be cut all at once. But if the
  <i>Fistula</i> be situated too far forward in the Fundament, the
  <i>Sphincter</i> of the <i>Anus</i> must not be entirely cut, otherwise
  the Excrements cannot be any longer retain'd. Lastly, when the
  <i>Fistula</i> hath been treated after this manner, all its Sinuosities
  or Winding-Passages ought likewise to be open'd, and the Wound being
  fill'd with thick Pledgets steept in some Anodyn, is to be cover'd with a
  Plaister and a Triangular Bolster; as also with the Bandage call'd the
  T.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Suture or Stitching of a </i>Tendon<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>It is requisite to undertake this Operation when the Tendons are cut,
  and when they become very thick. If the Wound be heal'd, it must be
  open'd again to discover the Tendon, and the Part must be bended, to draw
  together again the ends of the Tendons. Then the Surgeon taking a flat,
  streight, and fine Needle, with a double waxed Thread, passeth it into a
  small Bolster, and makes a Knot at the end of the Thread, to be stopt
  upon the Bolster. Afterward he pierceth the Tendon from the outside to
  the inside, at a good distance, lest the Thread shou'd tear it, and
  proceeds to pass the Needle in like manner under the other end of the
  Tendon, upon which is laid a small Bolster, for the Thread to be ty'd in
  a Knot over it. Then he causeth the Extremities of the Tendons to lie a
  little one upon another, by bending the Part, and dresseth the Wound with
  some Balsam. It may not be improper here to observe, that Ointments are
  never to be apply'd to the Tendons, which wou'd cause 'em to putrifie,
  but altogether Spirituous Medicaments; and that the Part must be bound
  up, lest the Extension of it shou'd separate the Tendons.</p>

<h3><i>Of the </i>Cæsarian<i> Operation.</i></h3>

  <p>When a Woman cannot be deliver'd by the ordinary means, this bold and
  dangerous Operation hath been sometimes perform'd with good Success. The
  Woman being laid upon her Back, the Surgeon makes a Longitudinal Incision
  beneath the Navel, on the side of the White-Line, till the <i>Matrix</i>
  appears, which he openeth, taking great care to avoid wounding the Child:
  Then he divides the Membranes with which it is wrapt up, separates the
  After-Burden from the <i>Matrix</i>, and takes out the Child. Lastly he
  washeth the Wound with warm Wine, and dispatcheth the <i>Gastroraphy</i>
  or Stitching up of the Belly, without sowing the <i>Matrix</i>. After the
  Operation, Injections are to be made into the <i>Matrix</i>, to cause a
  Flux of Blood; and a pierc'd Pessary must be introduc'd into its
  Neck.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XXI.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Amputation<i>, with
its proper Dressings and Bandages.</i></h3>

  <p>The Leg is usually cut off at the Ham; the Thigh as near as can be to
  the Knee; and the Arm as near as is possible to the Wrist: But an
  Amputation is never made in a Joynt, except in the Fingers and Toes.</p>

  <p>In order to cut off a Leg, the Patient is to be set on the side of his
  Bed, or in a Chair, and supported by divers Assistants; one of 'em being
  employ'd to hold the Leg at the bottom, and another to draw the Skin
  upward above the Knee, to the end that the Flesh may cover the Bone again
  after the Operation. In the mean while a very thick Bolster is laid under
  the Ham, upon which are made two Ligatures, <i>viz.</i> the first above
  the Knee, to stop the Blood, by screwing it up with the <i>Tourniquet</i>
  or <i>Gripe-Stick</i>; and the second below the Knee, to render the Flesh
  firm for the Knife. Before the Ligature is drawn close with the
  <i>Gripe-Stick</i>, a little piece of Paste-board is to be put
  underneath, for fear of pinching the Skin. Thus the Leg being well fixt,
  the Surgeon placeth himself between both the Legs of the Patient, to make
  the Incision with a crooked Knife, turning it circularly to the Bone, and
  laying one Hand upon the Back of the Knife, which must have no Edge.
  Afterward the <i>Periosteum</i> is to <span class="correction"
  title="catch-word only, not in text.">be</span> <!-- Page 250 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>{250}</span>scrap'd with an
  Incision-Knife, and the Flesh with the Vessels that lie between the two
  Bones are to be cut. When the Flesh is thus separated, a Cleft Band is to
  be laid upon it, with which the Heads are cross'd, to draw the Flesh
  upward, to the intent that the Bones may be cut farther, and that it may
  cover 'em after the Amputation, as also to facilitate the Passage of the
  Saw. Then the Surgeon holds the Leg with his Left-hand, and saweth with
  his Right, which he lets fall upon the two Bones, to divide 'em asunder
  at the same time, beginning with the <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i>, and
  ending with the <i>Tibia</i>. But it is necessary to incline the Saw, and
  to go gently in the beginning, to make way for it, and afterward to work
  it faster. The Leg being cut off, the Ligature must be unty'd below the
  Knee, loosening the <i>Gripe-Stick</i>, to let the Blood run a little,
  and to discern the Vessels with greater facility; and then the
  <i>Gripe-Stick</i> may be twisted again, to stop the Blood; which some
  Surgeons effect, by laying Pieces of Vitriol upon the Opening of the
  Arteries, and Astringent Powders, on a large Bolster of Cotton or Tow, to
  be apply'd to the end of the Stump; but if such a method be us'd, it is
  requisite that some Person be employ'd to keep on the whole Dressing with
  his Hand during twenty four Hours. However this Custom hath prevail'd in
  the Hospital of <i>Hôtel-Dieu</i> at <i>Paris</i>.</p>

  <p>Others make a Ligature of the Vessels, taking up the ends of 'em with
  a pair of <i>Forceps</i>, having a Spring; or with the <i>Valet a
  Patin</i>, which is a sort of Pincers that are clos'd with a small <!--
  Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>Ring
  let down to the bottom of the Branches. These Pincers being held by a
  Servant, the Surgeon passeth a Needle with wax'd Thread, into the Flesh,
  below the Vessel, bringing it back again, and with the two ends of the
  Thread makes a good Ligature upon the same Vessel; then he looseth the
  <i>Gripe-Stick</i> and the Band, the Stump is to be somewhat bended, and
  the Flesh let down to cover the Bones.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>After the Operation, it is requisite to lay small Bolsters upon the
  Vessels, and dry Pledgets upon the two Bones, as also many other Folds of
  Linnen strew'd with Astringent Powders; and over all another large
  Bolster or Pledget of Cotton or Tow, cover'd in like manner with
  Astringent Powders; then the whole Dressing is to be wrapt up with a
  Plaister and a Bolster, in form of a <i>Malta</i> Cross; so that there
  are three or four Longitudinal Bolsters, and one Circular.</p>

  <p>The Surgeon usually begins to apply the <i>Malta</i> Cross and Bolster
  under the Ham, crossing the Heads or Ends upon the Stump, and causeth 'em
  to be held by a Servant that Supports the Part; then he likewise crosseth
  the other Heads, and layeth on the two Longitudinal Bolsters that cross
  each other in the middle of the Stump, together with a third
  Longitudinal, which is brought round about the Stump, to stay the two
  former: These Bolsters ought to be three Fingers broad, and very long, to
  pass over the Stump. Afterward he proceeds to apply, <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Bandage commonly call'd </i>Capeline<i> by
</i>French<i> Surgeons, or the Head-Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>Which is prepar'd with a Band four Ells long, and three Fingers broad,
  roll'd up with one Ball, three Circumvolutions being made on the side of
  the cut Part, the Band is to be carry'd upward with Rollers, passing
  obliquely above the Knee; and is brought down again along its former
  Turns; If it be thought fit to make this Bandage with the same Band, it
  must be let down to the middle of the cut Part, and carry'd up again to
  the Knee, many back-folds being made, which are stay'd with the
  Circumvolutions, till the Stump be entirely covered, and the whole
  Bandage wrapt up with Rollers or Bolsters.</p>

  <p>The <i>Capeline</i> or Head-Bandage, having two Heads, is made with a
  Band of the same breadth, but somewhat longer. This Band being at first
  apply'd to the middle of the cut Part or Wound, the Heads are carry'd up
  above the Knee; and one of the Ends are turn'd backward, to bring it
  down, and to pass it over the end of the Stump. At every back-fold which
  is form'd above and below the Knee, a Circumvolution is to be made with
  the other end of the Band, to strengthen the back-folds, continuing to
  bring the Band downward and upward, till the whole Stump be cover'd: Then
  Rollers are made round <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'the about the'."
  >about the</span> Stump, and the Band is stay'd above the Knee. Afterward
  the Part may be brought to Suppuration, cleans'd and cicatriz'd.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XXII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Aneurism<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when the Surgeon hath prickt an Artery, or
  when a Tumour ariseth in an Artery.</p>

  <p>To this purpose the Patient is set in a Chair, and a Servant employ'd
  in holding his Arm in a Posture proper for the Operation; then a Bolster
  is to be laid four double, following the Progress of the Artery, to the
  end that the Ligature may better press the Vessel; and the Arm may be
  also surrounded with another single Bolster, on which is made a Ligature
  screw'd up with a <i>Gripe-Stick</i>, provided the Arm be not too much
  swell'd; for in this Case it wou'd be more expedient to deferr the
  Operation for fear of a Gangrene. The Artery being thus well stopt, the
  Surgeon lays hold on the Arm with one Hand, below the Tumour, and with
  the other makes an Incision with his Lancet, beginning at the bottom of
  the Tumour, and ending on the top along the Progress of the Artery. When
  the Tumour is open'd, the coagulated Blood may be discharg'd with a
  Finger; and if there are any Strings at the bottom, they may be cut with
  a crooked Pair of Sizzers, to the end that all the Clods of Blood, and
  other extraneous Bodies which are sometimes form'd in <i>Aneurisms</i>
  when they are very inveterate may be more <!-- Page 254 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>easily remov'd. But the
  <i>Gripe-Stick</i> must be loosen'd, to discover the Opening of the
  Artery with greater facility, and the Artery separated from the Membranes
  with a Fleam; for it wou'd be dangerous to cut it with a streight
  Incision-Knife: The Artery must also be supported with a convenient
  Instrument to divide it from the Nerve and Membranes; and to be assur'd
  of the Place of its Opening, the <i>Gripe-Stick</i> may be somewhat
  loosen'd, and afterward screw'd up again. In the mean time the Surgeon
  gives the Instrument to a Servant to hold, whilst he passeth under the
  Artery a crooked Needle with a wax'd String, cuts the Thread, and takes
  away the Needle: Then he begins to make the Ligature beneath the Opening
  of the Artery, tying at first a single Knot, on which may be put (if you
  please) a small Bolster, that may be kept steady with two other Knots: It
  is also necessary that another Ligature be made in the lower part of the
  Artery, by reason that the little lateral Arteries might otherwise let
  out Blood.</p>

  <p>The Artery ought not to be cut between the two Ligatures, lest the
  first Ligature shou'd be forc'd by the Impulsion of the Blood; but the
  Thread must be let fall, that it may rot with the Suppuration. Then the
  Wound may be dress'd with Pledgets, Bolsters strew'd with Astringent
  Powders and a Plaister; a Bolster being also laid in the Fold of the
  Elbow. <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Is made with a Band six Ells long, and an Inch broad, roll'd with one
  end, being at first apply'd with divers Circumvolutions under the Elbow,
  and moderately bound. Many turns are to be made, and a thick and streight
  Bolster, is to be laid upon the Tumour, (as in the Bandage for
  Phlebotomy) along the Artery, till it pass under the Arm-Hole: The Arm
  and Bolster must be surrounded with the Band, which is brought up with
  small Rollers, to the Arm-Pit, and stay'd with Circumvolutions round
  about the Breast. Afterward the Patient is to be laid in his Bed, with
  the Arm lying somewhat bended on the Pillow, and the Hand a little higher
  than the Elbow.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P.<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XXIII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Phlebotomy<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>To perform this Operation, the Surgeon holds the Lancet between his
  Thumb and Fore-finger, and three other Fingers lying upon the Patient's
  Arm, and thrusts the Point of the lancet into the Vessel, carrying the
  same Point somewhat upward, to make the Orifice the greater. If a Tendon,
  which is known by its hardness; or an Artery, which is discover'd by
  Pulsation, appear beyond the Vein, and very near it, the Lancet must be
  only set very <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page256"></a>{256}</span>forward in the Vein, and drawn back again
  streight, without turning it up, otherwise the Artery or Tendon wou'd be
  certainly cut with the Point. If the Artery or Tendon lies immediately
  under the Vein, the later must be prickt somewhat underneath, holding the
  Lancet inclin'd side-ways, and thrusting it very little forward; so that
  the Point will finish the Opening, by turning it upward.</p>

  <p>If the Artery stick too close to the Vein, the later is to be prickt
  higher or lower than it is ordinarily done; and if the Vein be
  superficial, and lie close upon a hard Muscle, the Lancet must not be
  thrust downright into the Vein, but it is requisite to carry it somewhat
  obliquely, and to take the Vessel above, lest the Muscle and its Membrane
  shou'd be prickt, which wou'd cause a great deal of Pain, and perhaps a
  vehement Inflammation. It is well known that the Veins of the Right Arm
  are usually open'd with the Right-hand, and those of the Left-Arm with
  the Left-hand.</p>

<h3><i>The Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Is made thus: The Surgeon having laid a Bolster upon the Orifice,
  keeps it close with two Fingers, and holds the Band or Fillet with the
  other Hand; then taking one end of the Fillet with the Middle-Finger,
  Fore-Finger, and Thumb, and applying it to the Bolster, he makes with the
  longest end of the Fillet divers Figures in form of the Letters KY in the
  Fold of the Arm; as also a back-fold with the shorter end of the Fillet,
  held between three <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page257"></a>{257}</span>Fingers. Afterward both ends of the Fillet
  are ty'd beneath the Elbow.</p>

  <p>If an Inflammation happens after the Operation, the Bolsters are to be

<h3><i>Of the Operation of </i>Encysted Tumours<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Tumours are small and hanging, and have a narrow bottom, a
  Ligature may be made with Horse-Hair or Silk, dipt in <i>Aqua-Fortis</i>,
  which will cause 'em to fall off of themselves after some time; or else
  they may be cut above the Ligature.</p>

  <p>If the Tumour or Wen be thick, and its bottom large, a Crucial
  Incision is to be made in the Skin, without impairing the <i>Cystis</i>
  or Bagg; and when the Incision is finish'd, the Bag may be torn off with
  the Nails, or with the Handle of a Pen-Knife; but sometimes it is
  necessary to dissect it. If there be any considerable Vessels at the
  Root, they may be bound, or else cut; and the Blood may be stopt with
  Astringents. If any parts of the <i>Cystis</i> remain, they are to be
  consum'd with Corrosives; and the Lips of the Wound are to be drawn
  together without a Stitch, making use <!-- Page 258 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span>only of an
  agglutinative Plaister. But if the Tumour adheres very close to the
  <i>Pericranium</i>, it is most expedient not to meddle with it at
  all.</p>

<h3><i>Of </i>Ganglions<i>.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Ganglions</i> are Tumours arising upon the Tendons and Nervous
  Parts, which may be cur'd by thrusting 'em violently, and making a very
  streight Bandage, provided they be very recent; a resolvent Plaister is
  to be also apply'd to the Part.</p>

  <p>This Operation is perform'd when it is necessary to discharge watry
  Humours out of the Head: If these Waters lie under the Skin, a very large
  Opening is to be made with a Lancet, and a small Tube or Pipe left
  therein to let 'em run out. If the Water be situated between the Brain
  and the <i>Dura Mater</i>, the Membrane is to be perforated with a
  Lancet, after the Trepan hath been apply'd, according to the usual
  Method, of which we have already given some account: Cauteries and
  Scarifications may be also us'd to very good purpose in this Disease.</p>

  <p>This Ligament may be cut with a little pair of Sizzers; to which
  purpose the Thumb of the Left-hand being laid upon the Gum of the lower
  Jaw, to keep the Mouth open, the Tongue may be rais'd upward with the
  Fore-Finger of the same Hand, and the Sizzers may be pass'd between the
  two Fingers, to divide the String as near as is possible to the Root of
  the Tongue, avoiding the Vessels: If an Hæmorrhage happens, recourse may
  be had to Styptick-Waters. Afterward the Nurse must take care to let a
  Finger be often put into the Child's Mouth, to prevent the re-uniting of
  the String.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of opening stopt
</i>Ductus<i>'s.</i></h3>

  <p>If there be only one Membrane that stops the Entrance of the
  <i>Vagina</i>, an Incision may be made, and a Leaden Pipe put into it,
  having Rings to fasten it to the Waste, to hinder the re-uniting of the
  Wound.</p>

  <p>If the Lips of the <i>Pudendum</i> are conglutinated or clos'd up, the
  Patient must be laid upon her Back, and her Knees rais'd up, in order to
  make an Incision with a crooked Incision-Knife, beginning at the Top; and
  then a Leaden Pipe is to be put into the Opening.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Vagina</i> be fill'd with a Fleshy Substance, an Incision is
  to be made therein, till it be entirely perforated, putting at the same
  time a Leaden Tube into the Orifice.</p>

  <p>If the Urinary <i>Ductus</i> as well in young Boys as in Virgins, be
  stopt up, an Incision is to be made therein with a very narrow Lancet;
  and if a small Leaden Pipe can be conveniently introduc'd, it may be
  done; but it is not very necessary, in regard that Children are almost
  always making Water, which wou'd of it self hinder the closing of the
  Orifice.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Ductus</i> of the Ear be stopt with a Membrane, it must be
  perforated, taking care not to go too far, for fear of piercing the
  Membrane of the <i>Tympanum</i> or Drum, and <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>a small Leaden Pipe is
  to be put into the Opening.</p>

  <p>If there be a carnous Excrescence on the outside of the Ear, a
  Ligature ought to be made therein, or else it may be cut with a pair of
  Sizzers, to cause it to fall off; and the rest of the Fleshy Substance
  that remains in the Ear must be consum'd with Causticks, convey'd to the
  Part by the means of a small Tube, care being had, nevertheless, to avoid
  cauterizing the <i>Tympanum</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Phimosis<i> and
</i>Paraphimosis<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>When the <i>Præputium</i> is so streight that the <i>Glans</i> can be
  no longer uncover'd, this Indisposition is call'd <i>Phimosis</i>; but if
  the <i>Præputium</i> be turn'd back above the <i>Glans</i>, after such a
  manner that it can no longer cover the same <i>Glans</i>, it is a
  <i>Paraphimosis</i>. If in the <i>Phimosis</i> the <i>Præputium</i>
  cleaves very close round about the <i>Glans</i>, it is most expedient to
  let it alone; but if in handling the <i>Glans</i> it be perceiv'd that it
  is moveable, or else that some parts of it only stick together, the
  Operation may be perform'd after this manner: The Patient being set in a
  Chair, a Servant is employ'd in pulling back the Skin to the Root of the
  <i>Penis</i>, to the end that the Incision may be <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span>made directly at the
  bottom of the <i>Glans</i>: Then the Surgeon having drawn out the bottom
  of the <i>Præputium</i>, introduceth a small Instrument with a very sharp
  Point on its flat side, at the end of which is fixt a Button of Wax,
  pierceth the <i>Præputium</i> at the bottom of the <i>Glans</i> on the
  side of the Thread, and finisheth the Incision by drawing the Instrument
  toward himself.</p>

  <p>The <i>Paraphimosis</i> is cur'd by making Fomentations on the Part,
  to allay the Inflammation if there be any; and it is to be pull'd down
  with the Fingers. But if Medicinal Preparations prove ineffectual,
  Scarifications are to be made round about the <i>Præputium</i>; and
  afterward convenient Remedies may be apply'd to remove the Inflammation,
  and prevent the Mortification of the Part; so that at length the
  <i>Præputium</i> may be drawn over the <i>Glans</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Varix<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In order to cure this Tumour, the Surgeon having first cut the Skin to
  discover the dilated Vein, separates it from the Membranes, and passeth
  underneath a crooked Needle with a double wax'd Thread; then he makes a
  Ligature both above and below the dilatation of the Vein, opens the
  dilated Part with a Lancet, to let out the Blood, and applies a
  convenient Bandage: But without performing this <!-- Page 263 --><span

  might be open'd with a Lancet, to draw out a sufficient quantity of
  Blood; and then the <i>Varix</i> is to be press'd with a somewhat close
  Bandage.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Operation of the </i>Panaritium<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>Panaritium</i> is an Abcess which ariseth at the end of the
  Fingers; some of these Tumours are only superficial, and others penetrate
  even under the <i>Periosteum</i>; nevertheless after whatsoever manner
  the <i>Panaritium</i> may happen, it ought to be open'd on the side of
  the Finger, that the Tendons may not be hurt. If the Abcess be extended
  under the <i>Periosteum</i>, the opening must be made on the side, and
  the Lancet thrust forward to the Bone: Afterward the <i>Pus</i> or
  corrupt Matter is to be discharg'd, which wou'd cause the Tendons to
  putrifie, if it shou'd remain too long upon 'em.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Are made with a Plaister cut in form of a <i>Malta</i> Cross, which is
  apply'd at the middle to the end of the Finger, the Heads being cross'd
  round about. The Bolsters must be also cut in the shape of the
  <i>Malta</i> Cross, or of a plain Cross only; the Band being a Finger's
  breadth <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span>wide, and long enough to be roll'd about
  the whole Dressing: It must be pierc'd at one of its ends, and cut the
  length of three Fingers at the other; so that the two Heads may pass
  thro' the Hole, to surround the Finger with small Rollers.</p>

  Cloth is to be laid upon the Neck of the fallen <i>Matrix</i>; and it is
  to be thrust very gently with the Fingers, without using much force. If
  the <i>Matrix</i> shou'd fall out again, it wou'd be requisite to convey

<h3><i>Of the Application of the </i>Cautery<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Cautery is an Ulcer which is made in the Skin, by applying
  Causticks to it, after this manner:</p>

  <p>The Surgeon having moisten'd the Skin for a while with Spittle, or
  else having caus'd a light Friction to be made with a warm Cloth, applies
  a perforated Plaister to the Part, and breaks the Cautery-Stone, to be
  laid in <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>the little Hole, leaving it for a longer
  or shorter time, accordingly as he knows its Efficacy, or as the Skin is
  more or less Fine. Afterward he scarifieth the Burn with his Lancet, and
  puts a Suppurative, or piece of fresh Butter into the Part, till the
  Escar be fallen off.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>After the Application of the <i>Lapis Infernalis</i>, or any other
  Cautery-Stone, it is necessary to lay over it a Plaister, a Bolster, and
  a Circular Bandage, which ought to be kept sufficiently close, to press
  the Stone, after a Pea or little Piece of Orrice-Root, hath been put into
  the Ulcer to keep it open. Then the Patient is to make use of this
  Bandage, with which he may dress it himself. Take a piece of very strong
  Cloth, large enough to roll up the Part without crossing above it: And
  let three or four Holes be made in one of its sides, as many small
  Ribbans or Pieces of Tape being sow'd to the other, which may be let into
  the Holes, as occasion serves, to close the Band.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Application of Leeches.</i></h3>

  <p>It is requisite that the Leeches be taken in clear running Waters, and
  that they be long and slender, having a little Head, the Back green, with
  yellow Streaks, and the Belly somewhat reddish. Before they are apply'd,
  it is also expedient to let 'em purge during some Days in fair Water,
  fast half a Day in a Box without Water. Afterward the Part being rubb'd
  or chaf'd with warm Water, Milk, or the Blood of some Fowl, the Opening
  of the Box is to be set to the Part, or the Leeches themselves laid upon
  a Cloth; for they will not fasten when taken up with the Fingers. The end
  of their Tail may be cut with a Pair of Sizzers, to see the Blood run,
  and to determine its quantity, as also to facilitate their sucking. When
  you wou'd take 'em away, put Ashes, Salt, or any other sharp thing upon
  their Head, and they will suddenly desist from their Work; but they are
  not to be pull'd off by force, lest they shou'd leave their Head or Sting
  in the Wound, which wou'd be of very dangerous consequence. When they are
  remov'd, let a little Blood run out, and wash the Part with salt Water.

<h3><i>The Dressing</i></h3>

  <p>Is made with a Bolster soakt in some Styptick Water, if the Blood will
  not otherwise stop; or in Brandy or <i>Aqua-Vitæ</i> if there be an

  <p>To perform this Operation, a Cotton or Silk Thread is to be taken,

  Pack-Needle; then the Patient sitting in a Chair, is to hold up his Head
  backward, whilst the Surgeon gripes the Skin transversely in the Nape of
  the Neck with his Fingers, or else takes it up with a Pair of
  <i>Forceps</i>, and passeth the Needle thro' the Holes of the
  <i>Forceps</i>, leaving the String in the Skin. As often as the Bolster
  that covers the Seton is taken off, that part of the String which lies in
  the Wound is to be drawn out, and cut off.</p>

  a greater or lesser quantity is to be laid on, accordingly as the Skin is

  as it is necessary; and afterward laying on a Bolster steept in Spirit of
  Wine. These are call'd dry Cupping-Glasses: But if you wou'd draw Blood,
  every thing is to be observ'd that we have now mention'd, besides that
  Scarifications are to be made, according to the usual manner; and the
  Cupping-Glass is to be set upon the Scarifications: But when the
  Cupping-Glass is half full of Blood, it must be taken off to be emptied,
  and the Application thereof is to be re-iterated, as often as it is
  required to take away any Blood. Lastly, the Incisions are to be wash'd

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the Nose.</i></h3>

  <p>When the Fracture is considerable, the Nostrils are stopt up, and the
  Sense of Smelling is lost. In order to reduce it, the Surgeon takes a
  little Stick wrapt up in Cotton, and introduceth it into the Nostrils as
  gently as is possible, to raise up the Bones again, laying the Thumb of
  his Left-hand upon the Nose, to retain 'em in their place. The Bones
  being thus set, he proceeds to prepare <!-- Page 273 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>{273}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>By conveying into the Nostrils certain Leaden Pipes of a convenient
  Bigness and Figure, which serve to support the Bones, and to facilitate
  Respiration. But care is to be had to avoid thrusting 'em up too far, for
  fear of hurting the sides of the Nose; and they are to be anointed with
  Oil of Turpentine mixt with Spirit of Wine: These Pipes are also to have
  little Handles, with which they may be fasten'd to the Cap. If there be
  no Wound in the Nose, there will be no need of a Bandage; but if the
  Fracture be accompany'd with a Wound, after having apply'd the proper
  Medicines, it wou'd be requisite to lay upon each side of the Nose a
  Triangular Bolster, cover'd with a little piece of Paste-board of the
  same Figure. This small Dressing is to be supported with a kind of Sling
  that hath four Heads; being a piece of Linnen-Cloath, two Fingers broad,
  and half an Ell long; it is slit at both ends, and all along, only
  leaving in the middle a Plain of three Fingers, that is to say, a part
  which is not cut. The Plain of this Sling is to be laid upon the
  Fracture, causing the upper Heads to pass behind the Nape of the Neck,
  which are to be brought back again forward; the lower Heads are likewise
  to be carry'd behind, crossing above the upper, and afterward to be
  return'd forward. If the Bones of the Nose be not timely reduc'd, a great
  Deformity soon happens therein, and a Stink caus'd by the Excrescences
  and <i>Polypus's</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the lower Jaw.</i></h3>

  <p>The Operator at first puts his Fingers into the Patient's Mouth, to
  press the Prominences of the Bones; and afterward doth the same thing on
  the outside. If the Bones pass one over another, a small Extension is to
  be made. If the Teeth be forc'd out of their Place, they are to be
  reduc'd, and fasten'd to the sound Teeth with a wax'd Thread.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Fracture be only on one side, a Bolster sow'd to a piece of
  Paste-board is to be laid upon the flat side of the Jaw, both being of
  the Figure and Size of the Jaw it self. The Bandage of this Fracture is
  call'd <i>Chevestre</i>, i.e. <i>a Cord or Bridle</i>, by the
  <i>French</i> Surgeons, and is made by taking a Band roll'd with one Head
  or End, three Ells long, and two Fingers broad; the Application of it is
  begun with making a Circumvolution round about the Head in passing over
  the Fore-head; then the Band is let down under the Chin, and carry'd up
  again upon the Cheek, near the lesser Corner of the Eye in passing over
  the Fracture; afterward it is rais'd up to the Head, and brought down
  again under the Chin, <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>to form a Roller or Bolster upon the
  Fracture: Thus three or four Circumvolutions and Rollers being made upon
  the Fracture, the Band is let down under the Chin, to stay and strengthen
  its several Turns, and is terminated round the Head, in passing over the
  Fore-head.</p>

  <p>If the Jaw be fractur'd on both sides, it wou'd be requisite to apply
  thereto a Bolster and Paste-board, perforated at the Chin, and of the
  Figure of the entire Jaw; the Bandage which we have even now describ'd,
  may be also prepar'd in making Rollers on both sides of the Jaw: Or else
  the double <i>Chevestre</i> may be made with a Band of five Ells long,
  and two Fingers broad, roll'd up with two Balls, that is to say, with the
  two Ends. The Application of this Band is begun under the Chin, from
  whence it is carry'd up over the Cheek, cross'd upon the top of the Head,
  and brought down behind the Head, where it is cross'd again; then it is
  let down under the Chin, cross'd there, and carry'd up over the Fracture;
  afterward the Band being pass'd three or four times over the same turns,
  in making Rollers upon the Jaws, is turn'd upon the Chin, and stay'd upon
  the Forehead round about the Head.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the </i>Clavicle<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Patient is to be set in a Chair, and his Arm is to be drawn
  backward, whilst an Assistant thrusts his Shoulder forward: In the mean
  time the Operator sets the Bones again in their place, by thrusting the
  Protuberances, and drawing out the sunk Bone.</p>

  <p>Or else a Tennis-Ball may be taken, and put under the Patient's
  Arm-Pit, whose Elbow is then to be press'd against his Ribs, whilst the
  Surgeon reduceth the Fracture.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the Patient may be laid upon his Back, putting a Convex
  Body under both his Shoulders, as a Bowl, or large wooden Porrenger; and
  then the Shoulders may be prest, to raise up the two ends of the Bones,
  which the Surgeon must take care to reduce.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>The Cavities which are above and below the Clavicle, are to be fill'd
  with Bolsters trimm'd with Paste-boards; another is to be also laid upon
  the Bone, which is almost of the same Figure with the Clavicle, and a
  large Bolster, to cover the three others: This Dressing is to be secur'd
  with the Bandage call'd the <i>Capeline</i> or Head-Bandage, provided the
  Fracture be in the middle of the Clavicle. A Band <!-- Page 277 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span>being taken about six
  Ells long, and four fingers thick, roll'd with two Balls; it is apply'd
  in the middle to the Fracture; one of its Heads or Ends is let down upon
  the Breast, whilst the other is pass'd behind the Back, below the
  Arm-hole, opposite to the indispos'd Arm-hole and above the Breast, to be
  carry'd over the other end of the Band, which is rais'd up, to make a
  Roller or Bolster upon the Fracture: The other end is pass'd under the
  indispos'd Arm-pit, and upon the Band that made the Roller, which is
  elevated by making a third Roller upon the Clavicle: These
  Circumvolutions around about the Body are continu'd, as also these
  Rollers upon the Clavicle, till it be entirely cover'd. Some
  Circumvolutions are also made upon the upper part of the Arm, near its
  Head: The Space that lies between the Rollers and the Circumvolutions of
  the Arm, and which bears the Name of <i>Geranium</i> or Stork's-Bill, is
  likewise cover'd with some Circumvolutions, and the Band is stay'd by
  making Circumvolutions quite round about the Body.</p>

  <p>If the Fracture were near the Head of the <i>Humerus</i> or Arm-Bone,
  a sort of Bandage might be prepar'd, which is call'd <i>Spica</i>, with a
  Band roll'd with one Ball five Ells long, and four fingers broad; one end
  of this Band is pass'd under the Arm-pit opposite to the indispos'd one
  behind the Back: The other end is convey'd under the indispos'd Arm-pit;
  the Figure of the Letters KY or X is made on the Shoulder; the Band is
  return'd below the other Shoulder behind; it is brought back again
  before, to form a second KY upon the <!-- Page 278 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>Fracture; three or four
  more KY's are wrought upon the Fracture; two Circumvolutions are made in
  the upper part of the <i>Humerus</i>, which constitute a Triangle call'd
  <i>Geranium</i>; this Triangle is cover'd with Rollers, and the Band is
  terminated round about the Breast.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the </i>Omoplata<i> or
Shoulder-Blade.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>Acromion</i> is usually fractur'd, but it may be known that the
  middle of the <i>Omoplata</i> is broken by a Numness which is felt in the
  whole Arm: Whereupon the Surgeon, after having examin'd the place of the
  Fracture, thrusts back the Prominences of the Bones into their place; and
  if any Splints happen to prick the Part, he makes an Incision to take 'em
  out, or to cut off their Points.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>A Bolster is laid upon the <i>Omoplata</i>, as also a large piece of
  Paste-board of the bigness and Figure of this Bone, and a sort of Bandage
  is prepar'd, known by the name of <i>the Star</i>, with a Band roll'd
  with one Head four Ells long, and as many Fingers broad. This Band is
  convey'd behind the Back, one of its ends lying under the Arm-hole,
  opposite to the indispos'd one; but the other is pass'd under the <!--
  Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page279"></a>{279}</span>Shoulder, and afterward above it, to make
  a KY in the middle of the Back; then passing under the other Arm-hole, it
  is brought up to the Shoulder, to be let down, and to form a second KY
  upon the middle of the Back: These Turns are continu'd in making Rollers,
  till the <i>Omoplatæ</i> are all cover'd: Circumvolutions are also made
  round the upper part of the <i>Humerus</i>, as in the <i>Spica</i>; and
  the Bandage is finish'd by Circumvolutions round about the Breast.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the Ribs.</i></h3>

  <p>When a Rib is broken, one of the ends pusheth into the Breast,
  sometimes on the outside; and sometimes the Ends lie against each other.
  In order to reduce it, the Patient being laid upon the sound Rib, a
  Plaister of Mastick is apply'd to the Fracture; and it is drawn out
  violently; so that sometimes this Attraction brings back the Bone, which
  is advanc'd into the Breast; but the surest way is to make an Incision
  therein, to raise it up with the Finger.</p>

  <p>If the Rib appear without, the Patient is to be set in a a Chair, and
  oblig'd to bend his Body on the side opposite to the Fracture, holding
  his Breath, with which he must puff strongly, without letting it forth,
  in order to dilate the Breast, whilst the Surgeon thrusts the Rib into
  its place.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>A Bolster is to be apply'd to the Fracture, with two little Pieces of
  Paste-board pass'd in form of a St. <i>Andrew's</i> Cross; and another
  Bolster upon the whole Dressing, on which is also laid a large square
  Paste-board cover'd with a Bolster. The Bandage is made with a Napkin
  folded into three Folds, which is put round the Breast, being sow'd and
  supported by the Scapulary; which is a Band six Fingers broad, perforated
  in the middle, to let in the Head. The two ends of the Scapulary are
  fasten'd before and behind to the Napkin.</p>

  <p>To reduce this Fracture, the Patient is to be laid upon his Back, with
  a Convex Body underneath; both his Shoulders are to be press'd with some
  weight, to push 'em backward, and to raise up the <i>Sternum</i>, which
  is sunk down; or else an Incision may be made upon the Bone, to discover
  it; and then a <i>Vectis</i> is to be apply'd thereto very gently, in

  <p>A Bolster and Paste-board are to be laid upon the <i>Sternum</i>,
  almost of the same Figure with the Part; and the Bandage is to be
  prepar'd with a Napkin supported with a Scapulary. Or else the Bandage
  call'd <i>Quadriga</i> may be made with a Band roll'd with two Heads,
  five Ells long, and four Fingers broad: The Application of this Band is
  begun under the Arm-pit; the Figure of KY is form'd under the Shoulder;
  the Band is carry'd downward with the two Balls, once before, and the
  other behind; it is pass'd under the other Arm-hole; the Heads are
  cross'd upon the Shoulder, and it is brought down backward and forward,
  forming a KY before and behind. Afterward the Bank is roll'd about the
  Breast in making Rollers or Bolsters; these Rollers are continu'd till

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the </i>Vertebra<i>'s.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>Apophyses</i> of the <i>Vertebra's</i> are commonly broken, and
  their Bodies but seldom: It may be known that the Body of the
  <i>Vertebra</i> of the Neck and Back is fractur'd by the Palsie of the
  Arm, accompany'd with the loss of Feeling; by the suppression of Urine;
  <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>{282}</span>and by the Palsie of the <i>Sphincter</i>
  of the <i>Anus</i>; so that the Excrements cannot be any longer retain'd.
  If these Symptoms appear, it may well be conceiv'd that the Marrow is
  compress'd, and prickt with Points; for the removing of which, it is
  necessary to make an Incision upon the Body of the <i>Vertebra</i> in the
  fractur'd Place.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Apophyses Spinosæ</i> are only fractur'd, these Accidents
  will not happen, only some Pain will be felt: To reduce 'em, the Patient
  is to be laid upon his Belly, and the Surgeon must use his utmost
  endeavours to raise up the Bone again, and to set it in its Natural
  Situation.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>If the <i>Apophysis Spinosa</i> were fractur'd, it wou'd be requisite
  to apply to each side of it a small long Bolster, which is to be cover'd
  with a Paste-board of the same Figure with the Bolster; another Bolster
  lying upon each Paste-board. The Bandage is to be made with a Napkin

  Hands, and afterward prepareth <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>It is necessary at first to lay round the Fracture a Bolster steept in
  some proper Liquor, as Claret or <i>Oxycratum</i>; then three several
  Bands are to be taken, three or four Fingers broad, and an Ell and a half
  long: The first of these is to be laid upon the Fracture, round which are
  to be made three very streight Circumvolutions; then it is to be carry'd
  up with small Rollers to the top of the Arm, and stay'd round the Body.
  The second Band being apply'd to the Fracture, on the side opposite to
  the first, two Circumvolutions are to be made upon the Fracture; so that
  the same Band may be brought down along the whole length of the Arm,
  making divers Rollers, and at last stay'd below the Elbow, which,
  nevertheless, it must not cover. Afterward our Longitudinal Bolsters must
  be laid upon the Fracture round about the Arm, which are to be kept close
  with a third Band; it being of no great Importance whether the
  Application of this third Band be begun at the Top or at the Bottom; but
  it may be stay'd round the Body, or else beneath the Elbow. The Arm ought
  also to be encompass'd with two thick pieces of Paste-board made round at
  the ends, and of the length of the Arm; but they must not cross one
  another. These Paste-boards are to be fasten'd with three Ribbands, and
  the Arm is to be put into a Scarf made with a large Napkin, which is to
  be first apply'd in the middle under the Arm-pit, the Arm resting upon
  it, so that <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  are terminated above the Knee; or else they may be continu'd all along
  the Leg; it is also to be pass'd under the Foot, and to be drawn up again
  upon the Leg: Then a Bolster is to be apply'd to the lower part of the

  everywhere even; and four Longitudinal Bolsters are to be added, on which
  are laid Splints of the same length and breadth, which are to be wrapt up

  made; whilst the Surgeon at the same time thrusts back again the
  upper-part of the Knee-Pan into its place.</p>

  <p>If the Knee-Pan be fractur'd in its length, no Extension can be made,
  because the pieces of the Bones remain in their place.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Knee-Pan be broken cross-wise, a Band is to be provided three
  Ells long, and two Fingers Broad, which may be roll'd with <!-- Page 292
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>one or two
  Heads. The Application is to be begun above the Knee-Pan; the Figure of
  KY is to be made in the Ham, and a Circumvolution under the Knee; then
  the Band is to be continually carry'd up and down, till the Knee-Pan be
  entirely cover'd.</p>

  <p>If the Knee-Pan be fractur'd in its length, that is to say, from the
  top to the bottom, the Uniting-Band must be us'd, being two or three Ells
  long, and two Fingers broad, perforated in the middle. It is to be at
  first apply'd under the Knee, and one of the Balls is to be pass'd thro'
  the Hole; it must also be well clos'd, and divers Circumvolutions are to
  be made upon the Knee-Pan, so as it may be altogether cover'd.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Fracture of the Leg.</i></h3>

  <p>If the <i>Tibia</i> be only broken, it pushes into the Inside; but if
  both Bones be fractur'd they are sometimes separated on both sides, or
  else they pass one upon another; and in this case the Leg is shorter than
  it ought to be. If the <i>Perone</i> be broken, it pushes to the
  outside.</p>

  <p>If one Bone be only fractur'd, so strong an Extension is not requisite
  as when they are both shatter'd, and it is to be drawn only on one side;
  whereas the drawing ought to be equal on both sides when both Bones are
  concern'd. <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>Thus whilst the Assistants are employ'd in
  drawing, the Surgeon performs the Operation, by laying the ends of the
  Bones exactly against one another; and they are known to be reduc'd when
  the great Toe remains in its Natural Situation.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>A simple Bolster dipt in a convenient Liquor is at first apply'd, and
  three Bands three Fingers broad are prepar'd, the first being two Ells
  long, the second three, and the third three and a half. Three very
  streight Circumvolutions are to be made upon the Fracture; the Band is
  also to be carry'd up with Rollers, and stay'd above the Knee. The
  Application of the second Band is to be begun upon the Fracture with two
  Circumvolutions; it is to be brought down with Rollers, to pass under the
  Foot, afterward carry'd up again, and stay'd where it is terminated. The
  Leg is to be fill'd with a Bolster thicker at the bottom than at the top;
  and then are to be laid on the four longitudinal Bolsters, two Fingers
  broad, and as long as the Leg; to which are to be apply'd the Splints of
  a plyable and thin Wood: These are wrapt up with a simple Bolster, and
  strengthen'd with the third Band, which is apply'd indifferently either
  at the top or bottom, opposite to the former; so that it is carry'd up or
  else down in making Rollers, and stay'd at its end. The whole Contexture
  is to be encompass'd with large Paste-boards made round at the Ends,
  which are not to cross one another, <!-- Page 294 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span>but must be streighter
  at the bottom than at the top, and are to be ty'd with three Ribbands or
  pieces of Tape, beginning at the middle; so that the Knots be ty'd on the
  outside. Afterward the Leg is to be put into the Scarves, and the Heel is
  to be supported with a Linnen-Roll, to which are fasten'd two Ribbands
  that are ty'd upon the Scarves: These Rolls are made with a small piece
  of Cloth, which is doubl'd, and roll'd up with the ends, in which is
  contain'd some Straw, and a little Stick in the middle, to consolidate
  'em. The Foot is supported with a Paste-board or Wooden Sole, trimm'd
  with a Bolster, or small Quilt sow'd over it. Divers Strings are also
  fasten'd to the middle of the sides of the Sole or Pump, which are
  cross'd to be joyn'd to the Scarves; and another is fixt at the end of
  the Sole, which is ty'd to a Ribband that binds the middle of the Scarf.
  These Scarves are likewise fasten'd with three Ribbands, beginning with
  that in the middle, the Knots being without, and trimm'd with four
  Bolsters, that is to say, two on each side, to fill up the Cavities that
  are below the Knee, and above the Ankle. Lastly, the Leg is to be plac'd
  somewhat high, and a Cradle to be laid upon it, to keep off the
  Bed-Cloaths, the Scarves passing over the Knee and Foot.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing of Complicated Fractures</i></h3>

  <p>Of the Arms, Legs, and Thighs is prepar'd with a Bandage having
  Eighteen Heads or Ends, in order to make which, a Linnen-Cloth is to <!--
  Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>{295}</span>be
  taken of the length of the Part, and broad enough to cause it to be
  cross'd thereby: It is to be folded into three doubles, and cut in three
  places on each side, leaving the middle plain; so that eighteen Heads or
  small Bands are form'd, every one of which will be four fingers broad,
  the upper Heads being a little shorter than the lower. This Band of
  eighteen Heads is to be laid upon the Scarves, and a Bolster is to be
  apply'd to it four Fingers broad, as long as the Scarves. The Leg is laid
  upon this Bolster, and it hinders the corrupt Matter from falling on the
  Bandage.</p>

  <p>When the Wound hath been dress'd, the fracture is to be incontinently
  surrounded with one of the Heads, which ought to cross one another: Then
  after the Leg hath been bound with the first Heads, two Longitudinal
  Bolsters are to be apply'd to the side of it; and the other Heads are to
  be rais'd up, with all the rest of the Dressing, which hath been
  describ'd in the simple Fracture.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Are made with a Band roll'd with two Heads, being three Ells long, and
  two Fingers broad: The Application of it is begun with a Circumvolution
  above the Ankles; it is pass'd on the Foot, and in like manner makes a
  Circumvolution round it: Afterward the same Band is cross'd over the
  <i>Metatarsus</i>, upon which are made some Folds in form of a
  <i>Rhombus</i> or Diamond; as also on the Toes, and it is stay'd above
  the Ankle-Bone; or else it is carry'd up along the Leg, to be stay'd
  above the Knee. This Bandage serves for all Fractures of the Bones of the
  Foot, and is call'd the <i>Sandal</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Nose.</i></h3>

  <p>The Bones of the Nose may be separated from that of the Fore-head by a
  Fall, or some violent Blow; and the Surgeon in order to set 'em, at first
  lays his Thumb upon the Root of the Nose, and then he introduceth a
  little Stick trimm'd with Cotton, into the Nostrils, and by the means
  thereof thrusts back the Bones into their place. <!-- Page 298 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>{298}</span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the lower-Jaw.</i></h3>

  <p>The Jaw may be luxated either on both sides, or only on one. When the
  Dislocation happens on both sides, it hangs over the <i>Sternum</i> or
  Breast-Bone, and the Spittle runs abundantly out of the Mouth: To reduce
  it, the Patient must sit down, and his Head is to be supported by a
  Servant; then the Operator or Surgeon having wrapt up his two Thumbs,
  puts 'em into the Mouth upon the Molar Teeth, his other Fingers lying
  under the Jaw, which is to be drawn down by raising it up, having before
  set two small Wooden Wedges upon the two Molar Teeth on both sides of the
  Jaw, lest the Surgeon's Fingers shou'd be hurt, as the Bone is returning
  to its place.</p>

  <p>If the Luxation be forward, a Band or Strap is to be put under the
  Chin, an Assistant having his Knees upon the Patient's Shoulders, where
  he is to draw the Strap upward, to facilitate the Extension; which the
  Surgeon makes with his Hands, at the same time thrusting the Bone back
  again into its place. <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>{299}</span></p>

  <p>When the Jaw is luxated only on one side, the Chin stands a-cross, and
  the dislocated side is squash'd down, a small Cavity being perceiv'd in
  it, and a Rising on the other side; so that the Mouth cannot be shut
  close, but <span class="correction" title="Original reads 're-remains' on line break."
  >remains</span> somewhat open, the lower Teeth appear farther out than
  the upper; and the Canine or Dog-Teeth lie under the Incisive. This
  Luxation is reduc'd by giving a blow with the Hand upon the luxated Bone,
  which is sufficient to cause it to re-enter its Natural Place.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  of the lower Jaw.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the </i>Clavicle<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The <i>Clavicle</i> is oftner loosen'd from the <i>Acromion</i> than
  from the <i>Sternum</i>; when it hath left the former the Arm cannot be
  lifted up; the <i>Acromion</i> makes a Prominence, and the Clavicle
  descends downward, a Cavity appearing in its place. To reduce this
  Luxation, the Patient is to be laid upon some Convex Body put between his
  Shoulders; both which are to be press'd backward, to raise up the
  Clavicle: Afterward he is to be set in a Chair, that his Arm may be drawn
  backward, whilst the <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>Surgeon is employ'd in pressing the
  Clavicle and <i>Acromion</i>, to join 'em together.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Are the same with those that we have already shewn, in treating of the
  Fracture of the Clavicle.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the </i>Vertebra'<i>s.</i></h3>

  <p>In the Luxation of the <i>Vertebra</i>'s of the Neck, the Head stands
  to one side, and the Face is swell'd and livid, with a difficulty of
  Respiration.</p>

  <p>To reduce this Dislocation, the Patient is to be set upon a low Seat,
  an Assistant leaning on his Shoulders, to keep his Body steady, whilst
  the Surgeon or Operator draws his Head upward, and turns it from one side
  to another: Then if the Accidents or Symptoms cease, the Cure is
  perform'd; so that Fomentations may be apply'd to the Part; and the
  Patient being laid in his Bed, must take care to avoid moving his
  Head.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Vertebra</i>'s of the Back or Loins are luxated on the
  inside, a sinking of the Bone is soon perceiv'd; whereupon the Patient
  being laid on his Belly, the Extension is to be made with Napkins pass'd
  under the Arm-Pits, and upon the <i>Os Ileum</i>, whilst the Surgeon with
  <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>{301}</span>a strong Extension makes some Efforts on
  the Spine, endeavouring to draw back the <i>Vertebra</i>. If that be not
  sufficient, an Incision is to be made upon the <i>Apophysis Spinosa</i>
  of the <i>Vertebra</i>; so that after having laid open this Process of
  the Bone, it may be taken out with a Pair of <i>Forceps</i>. Then the
  Wound is to be dress'd with Pledgets, a Plaister, and a Napkin, which
  must not be bound too close, for fear of pushing back the Spine.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Vertebra</i> is luxated on the outside, a Prominence
  appears; so that to reduce this Dislocation, the Extension is to be made
  as before, the Patient lying in like manner upon his Belly; but in order
  to push back the <i>Vertebra</i>, two little Sticks trimm'd with
  Linnen-Cloth are to be prepar'd, and laid along the two sides of the
  Spine of the <i>Vertebra</i>; yet these Sticks ought to be thick enough
  to remain more elevated than the <i>Apophysis Spinosa</i>; and a large
  wooden Roller is to be often roll'd upon 'em, which by its turning
  backward and forward, may thrust the <i>Vertebra</i>'s inward; so that
  when all the <i>Vertebra</i>'s are of an equal height, the Reduction is
  finish'd. If the <i>Vertebra</i>'s are luxated on the side, the same
  Extensions are to be made, and the Prominence is to be push'd, to
  re-establish the <i>Vertebra</i> in its place.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>The Dressing is prepar'd by laying two thin Plates of Lead on each
  side of the Spinous Process of the <i>Vertebra</i>, to maintain it in its
  Place, and a long Bolster over 'em. The <!-- Page 302 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span>proper Bandage is the
  <i>Quadriga</i>, which hath been before describ'd, in treating of the

  <p>If the <i>Coccyx</i> be sunk on the inside, it is to be rais'd with

  Luxation be on the outside, it may be gently thrust back again. An

  <p>The <i>Bunch</i> is nothing else but an exterior Luxation of the

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Ribs.</i></h3>

  <p>The Ribs are luxated either on the outside, or on the inside: If they
  be dislocated on the inside, a Cavity is perceiv'd near the
  <i>Vertebra</i>'s, the Patient drawing his Breath with Pain, and not
  being able to bend his Body.</p>

  <p>When the Luxation is on the outside, and happens in the upper Ribs,
  the Patient's Hands are to be hoisted upon the top of a Door, to raise up
  the Ribs, whilst the Surgeon presseth the Prominence of the Rib to
  restore it to its place.</p>

  <p>When the lower Ribs are luxated, the Patient must be oblig'd to stoop,
  laying his Hands upon his Knees, and the Prominence of the Bone is to be
  thrust back.</p>

  <p>If a Rib be luxated on the inside, an Incision is to be made to draw
  it out with the Fingers.</p>

  <p>To raise up the <i>Xiphoid</i> Cartilage, it must be fomented before
  for some time with Oil of Turpentine, or other Fomentations, made with
  Aromaticks; then the Patient is to be laid upon his Back, with a Convex
  Body underneath, and the Shoulders, and Sides of the Breast are to be
  press'd, to lift up the Cartilage. When this Operation is not sufficient,
  dry Cupping-Glasses are usually apply'd, till the Part be elevated, and a

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the </i>Humerus<i>, or
Arm-Bone</i>.</h3>

  <p>The Head of the <i>Humerus</i> generally falls under the Arm-Pit, so
  that the luxated Arm becomes longer than the other, the <i>Acromion</i>
  appears pointed on the outside; the Elbow starts from the Ribs, and
  cannot be mov'd without great Pain. To reduce this Bone, the <!-- Page
  305 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>{305}</span>Patient is
  to be set upon a low Seat, or else on the Ground, whilst some Person
  supports his Body with a Napkin: In the mean time the Surgeon is to lay
  hold on the upper-part of the <i>Humerus</i>, a Servant kneeling behind
  him, who is to hold the Patient's Arm above the Elbow, which is to pass
  between the Surgeon's Legs, and is to be drawn down by the Assistant as
  much as is possible, whilst the Surgeon in like manner draws the Arm, to
  remove the Head of the Bone out of the place where it was stopt; insomuch
  that the Bone sometimes makes a Noise in re-entring its Cavity.</p>

  <p>Or else the Patient's Arm may be laid upon the Shoulder of a taller
  Man than himself, who is strongly to draw the luxated Arm upon the
  Fore-part of his Breast; during which time, the Operator is to push the
  Head of the <i>Humerus</i>, to cause it to re-enter its Cavity.</p>

  <p>Otherwise the Patient may lie on the Ground, a Tennis-Ball being put
  under his Arm-Pit, which a Servant is to draw strongly with a
  Handkerchief pass'd under the Shoulder, whilst another Assistant stands
  behind the Patient, to thrust down the Shoulder with his Foot; at the
  same time the Surgeon sitting between the Patient's Legs, is to push
  strongly with his Heel the Ball that lies under the Arm-hole.</p>

  <p>Or else, a thick Battoon or Leaver may be laid on the Shoulders of two
  Men, after a Tennis-Ball hath been nail'd on the middle of it; otherwise
  a Bunch may be made therein, and cover'd with Linnen-Cloth; two Wooden
  Pins being also fixt on each side of the Ball: <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span>Then the Patient's
  Arm-Pit is to be set between those two Pins, and upon the Ball, where he
  is to remain hanging, whilst his Arm is pull'd down by main force. The
  same thing may be done by laying the Patient's Arm-Pit upon a Door, or
  else upon the Round of a Ladder.</p>

<h3><i>The Dressing and Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>A little Ball of Linnen is to be laid under the Arm-Pit, and
  underneath a Bolster with four Heads, which are cross'd upon the
  Shoulder; as also a Bolster under the sound Arm-Hole, that it may not be
  gall'd by the Bandage <i>Spica</i>, the Nature of which we have shewn in
  treating of the Fracture of the Clavicle.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Elbow.</i></h3>

  <p>When the Elbow is luxated on the inside, the Arm flies out, and the
  Hand is turn'd outward; but in the Luxation on the outside, the Arm is
  shortned: If the Luxation be Lateral, a Prominence appears in the
  Dislocated, and a Cavity in the opposite Part.</p>

  <p>To reduce the Internal Luxation, the <i>Humerus</i> and <i>Cubitus</i>
  are drawn, and at the same time the Surgeon bends the Elbow, by carrying
  <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>{307}</span>the Hand toward the Shoulder; or else a
  Tennis-Ball may be laid in the Fold of the Elbow, and the Arm drawn
  toward the Shoulder.</p>

  <p>For the External Luxation, the Extension is to be made, whilst the
  Surgeon thrusts back the Elbow into its place: Or else a round Stick may
  be taken, and trimm'd with Linnen-Cloth, with which the Bone is to be
  push'd back into its place during the Extension. This Stick may be also
  us'd in the reducing of the Internal Luxation.</p>

  <p>For the Lateral Luxations, the Extension may be made in like manner;
  the Surgeon at the same time thrusting back the Bone into its Natural
  Situation.</p>

<h3><i>The Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Is made with a Band five Ells long, and two Fingers broad, roll'd with
  one Ball: The Application of it is begun with a Circumvolution at the
  lower part of the <i>Humerus</i>, it is pass'd over the Fold of the Arm;
  a Circumvolution is also form'd in the upper-part of the Elbow, and the
  Figure of KY in its Fold. Afterward the Rollers are continu'd upon the
  Elbow, and the KY's in the inside of the Arm, till the Elbow be entirely
  cover'd: The Band is likewise carry'd up to the top of the Arm with
  Rollers, and stay'd round about the Body. The Patient must be oblig'd to
  keep his Bed, or else his Arm may be put in a Scarf, after the same
  manner as in the Fracture of the Arm.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Wrist.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Luxation be Internal, the Hand is turn'd back to the outside,
  so that for the Reduction thereof, it wou'd be requisite to cause the
  back of the Hand to be laid upon a Table, and the Extension to be made by
  drawing the Elbow and Hand, whilst the Surgeon takes care to press the
  Prominence.</p>

  <p>If the Luxation be External, the Hand is bended on the inside; so that
  to reduce it, the inside of the Hand is to be laid upon a Table, and the
  Surgeon is to press it after the Extension.</p>

  <p>If the Luxation be on the sides, the Hand is turn'd to one side; so
  that the Extension must be made, and the Hand turn'd on the side opposite
  to the Luxation. But the Fingers are usually drawn one after another, to
  the end that the Tendons may be set again in their Place.</p>

  <p>The eight Bones of the <i>Carpus</i> may be in like manner dislocated
  both on the inside and without; and to set 'em right, the Hand is to be
  laid upon a Table, and the Extension to be made, so as to press the
  Protuberances on the inside, if the Luxation be internal, and on the
  outside if it be external. <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Is prepar'd with a Band six Ells long, and two Fingers broad; so that
  three Circumvolutions may be made upon the Luxation; as also divers
  Rollers in passing thro' the inside of the Hand between the Thumb and the
  Forefinger, and in forming the Figure of KY upon the Thumb, after having
  made many Rollers upon the Wrist. Two Pieces of Paste-board are also to
  be laid on the sides of the Wrist, which are bound with the same Band in
  making Rollers; and the Hand is to be trimm'd with a Linnen-Ball, to keep
  the Fingers in their mean Situation. Then the Band is to be pass'd above,
  to strengthen it, and carry'd up with Rollers along the whole length of
  the Elbow, to be stay'd below the same Elbow.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Fingers.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Fingers be luxated, it is necessary to make an Extension to
  reduce 'em, and afterward to use the following</p>

<h3><i>Bandage.</i></h3>

  <p>If the Luxation be in the first Articulation or Joint, the Bandage
  <i>Spica</i> is to be apply'd, being made of a Band roll'd with one Head,
  an <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span>Ell long, and an Inch broad: It is begun
  with Circumvolutions round about the Wrist, and brought over the Luxation
  in passing between the Fingers. These Circumvolutions are also continu'd
  to form a <i>Spica</i> upon the Luxation; and the Band is stay'd at the
  Wrist.</p>

  <p>If all the first <i>Phalanges</i> were dislocated, it wou'd be
  requisite to make as many upon every <i>Phalanx</i>, and with the same
  Band: This sort of Bandage is call'd the <i>Demi-Gantlet</i>.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P. <span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XIII.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Thigh.</i></h3>

  <p>The Luxation which most commonly happens in this Part, is the
  Internal; so that a Protuberance appears on the Hole of the <i>Os
  Pubis</i>; the indispos'd Leg is longer than the other, and the Knee and
  Foot turn outward; neither can the Thigh be any longer bended, nor drawn
  near the other.</p>

  <p>If the Luxation be External, the Leg becomes shorter than the other,
  the Knee and Foot turning inward, and the Heel to the outside.</p>

  <p>When the Luxation is on the fore-part, a Tumour ariseth in the Groin,
  so that the Patient cannot draw this Thigh toward the other, nor bend the
  Leg; his Body resting only upon the Heel.</p>

<p><!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>{311}</span></p>

  <p>If the Luxation be Posterior, a Tumour is felt in the Buttocks with
  great Pain, and the Legg is shorter than it ought to be: There also
  appears a sinking in the Groin, the Leg is lifted off from the Ground,
  and the hurt Person is apt to fall backward.</p>

  <p>To reduce the Internal Luxation, the Patient is to be laid with his
  Back upon a Table, to which is fixt a thick Wooden Pin, about a Foot
  long, which is to be set between his Thighs, to detain his Body when his
  Legs are drawn down; then a Strap is to be pass'd above the joynt of the
  Thigh, to draw the <i>Ischion</i> upward; and the Thigh is to be drawn
  down with another Strap fasten'd above the Knee: In the mean while the
  Surgeon thrusts the Thigh upward, to cause it to re-enter its Cavity, the
  Straps being somewhat loosen'd in the time of the Reduction to facilitate
  the Operation.</p>

  <p>To reduce the External Luxation, the Patient is to be laid upon his
  Belly; and the drawing to be perform'd after the same manner as we have
  even now shewn, whilst the Thigh is thrust from the outside inward, to
  cause the bone to re-enter its Cavity.</p>

  <p>In reducing the Anterior Luxation, the hurt Person is to be laid upon
  the side opposite to the Luxation, and Extensions are to be made, by
  drawing both upward and down-ward, as before: Then the Head of the Bone
  is to be forc'd, by the means of a Ball thrust strongly with the Knee, in
  drawing the luxated leg toward the other. <!-- Page 312 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>{312}</span></p>

  <p>The Posterior Luxation is thus reduc'd; The Patient being laid upon
  his Belly, the double Extension is to be made, and his Knee drawn
  outward, to set the Bone in its place. After the Operation hath been
  perform'd, a Bolster is to be apply'd, steept in Spirituous Medicaments;
  and the Bandage call'd <i>Spica</i>, of which we have given an Account in
  treating of the Luxation of the Shoulder.</p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P. <span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XIV.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the Knee.</i></h3>

  <p>When the <i>Tibia</i> is luxated behind, its Prominences are in the
  Cavity of the Ham, and the Leg flies off, or is bended. If the same
  <i>Tibia</i> be dislocated on the side, a kind of Tumour appears in the
  luxated side, and a Sinking in the opposite. But if the <i>Condylus</i>
  of the <i>Tibia</i> remains in the inside, the Leg turns outward; and if
  it be in the outside, it turns inward.</p>

  <p>The Posterior Luxation is reduc'd by obliging the Patient to lie upon
  his Belly, whilst the Surgeon during the Extensions bends the Leg, in
  drawing the Heel toward the top of the Thigh.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Tibia</i> be luxated on the side, the usual Extensions are
  to be made, and the Bone is to be push'd with the Knee. <!-- Page 313
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span></p>

  <p>If the Luxation were in the fore-part, it wou'd be requisite to lay
  the Patient upon his Back, to make the Extensions, by drawing the Thigh
  and Leg; and to press the protuberant Parts.</p>

<h3><i>The Bandage</i></h3>

  <p>Is prepar'd with a Band three Ells long, and two Fingers broad, roll'd
  with two Balls: A Circumvolution being at first made above the Knee, the
  Figure KY is form'd underneath, and a Circumvolution above it; then the
  Band is carry'd up again over the Knee, in making Rollers and KY's
  underneath, till the Knee be entirely cover'd.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>

<h3>C<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>H<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span>P. <span class="gsp">&nbsp;</span> XV.</h3>

<h3><i>Of the Luxation of the </i>Patella<i> or
Knee-Pan.</i></h3>

  <p>The Knee-Pan is luxated by starting upward; and to reduce it, the
  Patient's Leg is to be held streight, whilst it is thrust back into its
  place with the Hands. Then he must be oblig'd to keep his Bed; and the
  same Bandage is to be apply'd with that which hath been describ'd for the
  Luxation of the Knee.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Perone</i> or <i>Fibula</i> be remov'd from the
  <i>Tibia</i>, the sides of the Foot are to be press'd, to draw it back
  again; and it may be kept close <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page314"></a>{314}</span>with the Bandage which is appropriated to
  the Fractures of the <i>Tarsus</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Astragalus</i> may be also luxated in the fore-part; so that
  the Operator ought to thrust it back into its place, and to make use of
  the Bandage which we have prepar'd for the Fracture of the Foot.</p>

  <p>The <i>Calcaneum</i> sometimes flies off from the <i>Astragalus</i>
  both in the inside and without; and the Bones of the <i>Tarsus</i>,
  <i>Metatarsus</i>, and Toes are likewise apt to be luxated. But a little
  Circumspection is only requisite to reduce all these Dislocations.</p>

<h3><i>Of Balsams.</i></h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="full" />

<h3><i>The Balsam of </i>Arcæus<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take two Pounds of the Suet of a He-Goat, <i>Venice</i> Turpentine and
  Gum <i>Elemi</i>, a Pound and a half of each; and of Hogs-Lard one Pound.
  After the Gum <i>Elemi</i>, being cut into small Pieces, hath been melted
  over a very gentle Fire, add to it the Turpentine, Goats-Suet, and <!--
  Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page316"></a>{316}</span>Swines-Grease; and when all these
  Ingredients are well dissolv'd, strain the Liquor thro' a new
  Linnen-Cloth, to separate the Scum and Dregs from it; then let the whole
  Mass cool, and the Balsam is made.</p>

  <p>This Balsam serves to incarnate and consolidate all sorts of Wounds
  and Ulcers: It is likewise us'd in Fractures and Dislocations of the
  Bones; as also to cure the Contusions and Wounds of the Nerves.</p>

<h3><i>The Balsam of </i>Spain<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take pure Wheat, the Roots of Valerian and <i>Carduus Benedictus</i>,
  of each one Ounce, and beat 'em well in a Mortar with a Pint of
  White-Wine; strain the whole Composition into an Earthen Vessel Leaded,
  having a narrow Mouth; stop up the Vessel, and set it upon hot Embers
  during twenty four Hours: Then add six Ounces, of St. <i>John</i>'s Wort;
  set the whole Mass in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>, till the Wine be consum'd and
  let it be strain'd and squeez'd. Afterward add two Ounces of Frankincense
  well pulveriz'd, with eight Ounces of <i>Venice</i> Turpentine, mixing
  'em together over a gentle Fire, and the Balsam will be made.</p>

  <p>This is the Balsam which was always us'd by <i>Hieronymus Fabritius ab
  Aguapendente</i>, a noted <i>Italian</i> Surgeon, and is excellent for
  all kinds of Wounds, even for the Nervous, which (as it is avouch'd by
  some Persons) may be cur'd by it within the space of twenty four Hours.
  But the Wound must be at first wash'd with good White-Wine cold, and
  afterward anointed <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span>with this Balsam well heated. If the Wound
  be deep, it may be syringed with the same Balsam very hot, and the sides
  of it anointed when drawn together. Then a Bolster steep'd in the Balsam
  is to be apply'd to the Part, and upon that another Bolster soakt in the
  Lees of Wine; as also over this last another drie Bolster.</p>

<h3><i>The Green Balsam.</i></h3>

  <p>Take Linseed-Oil and that of Olives, of each one Pint; one Ounce of
  Oil of Bays; two Ounces of <i>Venice</i> Turpentine, half an Ounce of the
  destill'd Oil of Juniper-Berries, three Drams of Verdegrease, two Drams
  of Sucotrin Aloes, two Drams and a half of White Vitriol, and one of the
  Oil of Cloves.</p>

  <p>Having made choice of the best Olive and Linseed-Oil well purify'd and
  mingl'd together in a Skillet or Pan over a very gentle Fire, let the
  Turpentine and Oil of Bays be incorporated in it; then having taken off
  the Pan from the Fire, and left the Liquor to be well cool'd, let it be
  intermixt by little and little with the Verdegrease, the White Vitriol,
  and the Sucotrin Aloes beaten to fine Powder: Afterward the destill'd
  Oils of Cloves and Juniper-Berries being added, and the whole Composition
  well mingl'd together, the Balsam will be entirely compounded according
  to Art.</p>

  <p>This is the Balsam that hath been so much talkt of at <i>Paris</i>,
  and which many Quack-Salvers, pretending to the Art of Physick and
  Surgery, keep as a great Secret. Indeed it is very good for all sorts of
  Wounds, whether they <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>be made by the Sword, or other Iron
  Weapons, or by Gun-shot. But it wou'd be requisite at first to wash the
  Wound with warm Wine, then to anoint it with this Balsam very hot, and to
  apply Bolsters that have been steept in it, as also a large Bolster over
  the other, dipt in some Styptick Liquor. This Balsam mundifies,
  incarnates, and cicatrizes Wounds; being likewise good against the
  Bitings of venomous Beasts, and fistulous and malignant Ulcers.</p>

<h3>Samaritan<i> Balsam.</i></h3>

  <p>Take an equal quantity of common Oil and good Wine; boil 'em together
  in a glaz'd Earthen Vessel, till the Wine be wholly consum'd, and the
  Balsam will be made. I have produc'd this Balsam in particular, by reason
  of its simplicity, and in regard that it may be readily prepar'd at all
  times. It serves to mundifie and consolidate simple Wounds more
  especially those that are recent.</p>

<h3><i>Of Ointments.</i></h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="full" />

<h3>Unguentum Althææ<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take of the Roots of <i>Althæa</i> or Marsh-Mallows, six Ounces, the
  Seeds of Line, and Fenugreek, and Squills, of each four Ounces; of yellow
  Wax one Pound; Colophony and Rosin, of each one Pound; <i>Venice</i>
  Turpentine, <i>Galbanum</i>, and Gum <i>Hederæ</i> pulveriz'd, two Ounces
  of each. The Marsh-Mallow-Roots being newly gather'd, are to be well
  wash'd and slic'd, as well as the Squills. After they have been put into
  a Copper-Pan or Skillet, tinn'd over on the inside, together with the
  Seeds of Line and Fenugreek, and a Gallon of fair Water pour'd upon 'em,
  the whole Mass is to be macerated during twenty four Hours, over a very
  gentle Fire, stirring the Ingredients from time to time with a Wooden
  <i>Spatula</i>: Thus they are to be boil'd slowly, often reiterating the
  stirring, till the Mucilages are sufficiently thicken'd; then, after
  having well squeez'd and strain'd 'em thro' a strong and very close
  Cloth, and mingl'd 'em with the prepar'd Oil, they are to be boil'd
  together again over a very gentle Fire, till the Superfluous Moisture of
  the Mucilages be wholly <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span>consum'd: Afterward having strain'd the
  Oil again, the yellow Wax, Colophony, and Rosin cut into small pieces,
  are to be melted in it; and if any Dregs appear at the bottom of the Pan,
  when the whole Mass is dissolv'd, it is to be strain'd a-new, or at least
  the pure Liquor must be separated from the gross or impure by
  Inclination, whilst it is as yet very hot: The Ointment is to be stirr'd
  about with a Wooden Pestle; and when it begins to grow thick, you may add
  the Turpentine, the <i>Galbanum</i> purify'd and thicken'd, and the Gum
  <i>Hederæ</i> beaten to fine Powder, all which Ingredients were before
  incorporated together. Then the Ointment is to be continually stirr'd,
  till it be altogether grown cold.</p>

  <p>This Ointment serves to moisten, mollifie, and heat gently; it also
  allayes the Pains of the Side, and softens Tumours, particularly the
  <i>Parotides</i>. It may be us'd either alone, or with other Ointments or
  Oils.</p>

<h3><i>The mundificative Ointment of Smallage.</i></h3>

  <p>Take three handfuls of Smallage-Leaves; with Ground-Ivy, great
  Wormwood, great Centory, Germander, Sage, St. <i>John</i>'s-Wort,
  Plantain, Milfoil or Yarrow, Perewinkle, the greater Comfrey, the lesser
  Comfrey, Betony, Honey-suckle, Fluellin, Vervein, Knot-Grass,
  Adders-Tongue, and Burnet, of every one of these Plants two handfuls; a
  Gallon of common Oil, white Pitch, Mutton-Suet, yellow Wax, and
  Turpentine, of each two Pounds. <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>{321}</span></p>

  <p>Bruise all these Herbs in a Marble-Mortar; let the Wax, white Pitch,
  and Mutton-Suet cut into pieces, as also the Turpentine be melted in the
  Oil, in a Copper-Pan lin'd with Tin, over a moderate Fire; put the
  bruis'd Herbs in it, and cause the whole Mass to simmer together very
  slowly, stirring it about from time to time with a Wooden <i>Spatula</i>.
  As soon as it shall be perceiv'd that the Oil of the Herbs is almost
  quite consum'd, the whole Composition is to be strain'd, and strongly
  squeez'd. Then after having let the Ointment cool, to draw off all the
  Dregs and Moisture, it is to be dissolv'd over a very gentle Fire; and
  after having left it a little while to cool again and thicken, you may
  add thereto Myrrh, Aloes, <i>Florence</i> Orris, and round Birth-Wort
  pulveriz'd very fine. When all these Ingredients are by this means well
  incorporated, the Ointment will be brought to perfection.</p>

  <p>This Ointment is of singular Use to cleanse Ulcers; as also to
  mundifie, cicatrize, and consolidate all sorts of Wounds.</p>

<h3><i>The black or suppurative Ointment.</i></h3>

  <p>Take a Quart of common Oil, white and yellow Wax, Mutton-Suet that
  lies near the Kidneys, pure Rosin, Ship-Pitch, <i>Venice</i> Turpentine,
  of each half a Pound; and of Mastick beaten to fine Powder, two Ounces;
  let all that is capable of being dissolv'd, be liquify'd in the Oil; and
  add the Powder of Mastick to make an Ointment. <!-- Page 322 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span></p>

  <p>This Ointment searches and opens all sorts of Impostumes, as well as
  Carbuncles, and Pestilential and Venereal Bubo's. The use of the same
  Ointment is also to be continu'd after the opening of the Abcesses, till
  their perfect Cure be compleated.</p>

<h3>Unguentum Rosatum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take Bore's-Grease well purify'd, and often wash'd, and Red Roses
  newly pickt, of each four Pounds, with the like quantity of White
  Roses.</p>

  <p>The thin Membrane or Skin which lies upon the Bores-Grease, being
  taken away, it is to be cut into small pieces, well wash'd in fair Water,
  and melted in a glaz'd Earthen-Pot over a very gentle Fire; the first
  Grease that is dissolv'd is to be strain'd thro' a Cloth, well wash'd,
  and mixt with the same quantity of thick Rose-Buds well bruis'd. Then the
  whole Mass is to be put into a glaz'd Earthen-Pot with a narrow Mouth;
  the Pot is to be well stopt, and set during six Hours in Water, which is
  between luke-warm and boiling hot. Afterward it is to be boil'd an Hour,
  strain'd and strongly squeez'd. In the mean while four Pounds of White
  Roses newly blown are to be taken, well bruis'd, and mingl'd with the
  former Composition, the Pot being cover'd, which is likewise set for the
  space of six Hours in Water, between luke-warm and boiling hot: Then the
  Liquor is to be strain'd and strongly squeez'd. Lastly, after the
  Ointment hath been cool'd, and separated from its <i>Fæces</i> or Dregs,
  it may be kept for use. <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>{323}</span></p>

  <p>If it be desir'd to give a Rose-Colour to this Ointment, it wou'd be
  requisite a quarter of an Hour before it be strain'd the last time, to
  throw into it two or three Ounces of <i>Orcanet</i>, which is to be
  stirr'd into the Ointment. If it be thought fit to retain the White
  Colour, and to produce the smell of Roses, it may be done with
  Damask-Roses without <i>Orcanet</i>. If you are desirous to give it the
  Consistence of a Liniment, you may add Oil of sweet Almonds to the
  quantity of a sixth part of its weight.</p>

  <p>This Ointment is a very good Remedy against all manner of external
  Inflammations, particularly against <i>Phlegmons</i>,
  <i>Erysipelas's</i>, and Tetters; as also against the Head-ach and
  Hæmorrhoids or Piles.</p>

<h3>Unguentum Album, aut de Cerussa<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take three Pints of Oil of Roses, nine Ounces of white Wax, one Pound
  of <i>Venice</i> Ceruse or white Lead, and a Dram and a half of
  Camphire.</p>

  <p>The Ceruse being pulveriz'd by rubbing the pieces upon the Cloath of a
  Hair-Sieve turn'd upside-down; the Powder is to be receiv'd on a Sheet of
  Paper laid underneath, and to be often wash'd with Water in a great
  Earthen-Pan, stirring it about with a Wooden <i>Spatula</i>, and pouring
  off the Water by Inclination as soon as the Powder is sunk to the Bottom.
  When the Water of these Washings grows insipid, the last Lotion is to be
  made with Rose-Water, leaving it for the space of five or six Hours,
  which being expir'd, it is to be pour'd off by Inclination, and <!-- Page
  324 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span>the Ceruse
  must be dry'd in the Shade, cover'd with Paper. Then the broken Wax and
  prepar'd Oil is to put into a glaz'd Earthen-Pot, and the Pot into the
  boiling Bath. As soon as the Wax is melted, the Pot may be taken out of
  the Bath, and the dissolv'd Liquor stirr'd with a Wooden Pestle till it
  begins to grow thick. Afterward the pulveriz'd Ceruse is to be infus'd,
  and the Ointment stirr'd about till it be almost cold. If you shall think
  fit to add Camphire, let it be dissolv'd in a little Oil, and
  incorporated with the Ointment when it is cold. The Whites of Eggs may be
  also well mixt with the Ointment, by stirring it about, to make an exact
  union of the several Ingredients.</p>

  <p>This Ointment is good for Burns, <i>Erysipelas's</i>, the Itch, and
  many Distempers of the Skin; it allayes the Itchings and intemperature of
  Ulcers; it dissipates the Chafings and Redness that happen in the Bodies
  of Infants; It is of great efficacy in the healing of Contusions, and it
  serves to consolidate and cool light Wounds.</p>

<h3>Unguentum Ægyptiacum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take eleven Ounces of Verdegrease, fourteen Ounces of strong Vinegar,
  and twenty eight Ounces of good Honey.</p>

  <p>Let the Verdegrease be put into a Copper-Pan or Skillet over a very
  gentle Fire; then bruise it with a Wooden Pestle; work it well in the
  Vinegar, and strain the whole thro' a Hair-Sieve. If a little Verdegrease
  remains on the Sieve, it is to be put again into the <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span>Skillet
  bruis'd and beaten small therein, as before, with a Portion of the same
  Vinegar, straining it thro' the Sieve, till the unprofitable drossy parts
  of the Copper be only left. Afterward this Liquor is to be boil'd over a
  gentle Fire, with the Honey, stirring it about from time to time till it
  hath acquir'd the Consistence of a softish Ointment, and a very red
  Colour.</p>

  <p>This Ointment consumes putrify'd Flesh, and the Superfluities of
  Ulcers and Wounds.</p>

<h3>Unguentum Basilicon<i>, or Royal Ointment</i>.</h3>

  <p>Take yellow Wax, Mutton-Suet, Rosin, Ship-Pitch, and <i>Venice</i>
  Turpentine, one Pound of each; with five Pints of common Oil.</p>

  <p>Cut the Suet, Rosin, and black Pitch into small Pieces, and let 'em be
  melted together, with the Oil, in a Copper-Pan over a very moderate Fire;
  then after having strain'd the Liquor thro' a thick Cloth, let it be
  incorporated with the Turpentine, and the Ointment will be made.</p>

  <p>It promotes Suppuration, and cicatrizes Wounds when the purulent
  Matter is drawn forth. It is often laid alone upon the Bolsters, and
  sometimes mixt with the Yolks of Eggs, Turpentine, and other Ointments,
  or with Oils and Plaisters. <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326"></a>{326}</span></p>

<h3><i>A cooling Cerate.</i></h3>

  <p>Take a Pint of Oil of Roses, and three Ounces of white Wax.</p>

  <p>Let the whole Composition be put into a glaz'd Earthen-Pot, and the
  Pot set in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>, till the Wax be well dissolv'd in the
  Oil: Then take the Vessel out of the Bath, and stir the Ointment with a
  Wooden Pestle till it be cool'd; add two Ounces of Water, and stir it
  about with the Pestle till it be imbib'd by the Cerate; let as much more
  Water be infus'd, and again the same quantity, till the Cerate becomes
  very white, and hath been well soakt with fresh Water. Afterward all the
  Water is to be pour'd off by Inclination, and separated as much as is
  possible from the Cerate, which may then be kept for use; but some
  Surgeons cause an Ounce of Vinegar to be mingl'd with it.</p>

  <p>This Cerate is usually laid outwardly upon all Parts that stand in
  need of cooling, and asswages the Pains of the Hæmorrhoids or Piles. It
  is also good for Chaps, sore Nipples, and other ill Accidents that happen
  in the Breast; and is us'd for Burns either alone, or mixt with other
  Ointments. Whensoever it is necessary to apply Desiccatives and
  Astringents to any Part, this Cerate may be mingl'd with <i>Unguentum de
  Cerussa</i>. <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

<h3><i>An Ointment for Burns.</i></h3>

  <p>Take a Pound of Bores-Grease, two Pints of White-Wine, the Leaves of
  the greater Sage, Ground- and Wall-Ivy, Sweet Marjoram, or the Greater
  House-Leek, of each two handfuls.</p>

  <p>Let the whole Mass be boil'd over a gentle Fire, and having afterward
  strain'd and squeez'd it, let the Ointment so made be kept for use.</p>

<h3><i>Of Plaisters.</i></h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="full" />

<h3><i>The Plaister of </i>Diapalma<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take three Pounds of prepar'd Litharge of Gold, three Pints of common
  Oil, two Pounds of Hogs-Lard, a Quart of the Decoction of Palm-Tree or
  Oak-Tops; four Ounces of Vitriol calcin'd till it become red, and steept
  in the said Decoction. Having bruis'd or cut very small two handfuls of
  Palm-Tree or Oak-Tops, let 'em be boil'd slowly in three Quarts of Water
  till about half be consum'd; and after the whole Mass hath been well
  squeez'd, the strain'd Decoction is to be preserv'd. In the mean time the
  Litharge is to be <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>pounded in a great Brass Mortar, and
  diluted with two or three Quarts of clear Water; but it will be requisite
  readily to pour out into another Vessel the muddy Water which is
  impregnated with the more subtil part of the Litharge, whilst the thicker
  remains at the bottom of the Mortar; whereupon this part of the Litharge
  will sink to the bottom of the Water, and the Litharge remaining in the
  Mortar is to be pounded again. Then having diluted it in the Water of the
  first Lotion, or in some other fresh Water, the muddy Liquor is to be
  pour'd by Inclination upon the subtil Litharge that remain'd in the
  bottom of the Vessel: Afterward you may continue to pound the Litharge,
  to bruise it in the Water, to pour it off by Inclination, and to let the
  Powder settle, till there be left only at the bottom a certain impure
  part of the Litharge, capable of being pulveriz'd, and rais'd amidst the
  Water. As soon as the Lotions are well settl'd, and care hath been taken
  to separate by Inclination the Water which swims over the Powder of
  Litharge; this Powder is to be dry'd, and having weigh'd out the
  appointed Quantity, it is to be put as yet cold into a Copper-Pan lin'd
  with Tin, and stirr'd about to mingle it with the Oil, Lard, and
  Decoction of Palm-Tree-Tops. When these Ingredients have been well
  incorporated together, a good Charcoal Fire must be kindl'd in a Furnace,
  over which they are to be boil'd, stirring 'em continually with a great
  Wooden <i>Spatula</i>, and constantly maintaining an equal Degree of Heat
  during the whole time of their boiling. At last you may add <!-- Page 329
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span>the rubify'd
  Vitriol dissolv'd in a Portion of the Liquor that hath been reserv'd, if
  you wou'd have the Plaister tinctur'd with a red Colour; or else white
  Vitriol melted in the same Decoction, if it shall be thought fit to
  retain the Whiteness of the Plaister, which may be form'd into Rolls, and
  wrapt up with Paper.</p>

  <p>This Plaister is us'd for the cure of Wounds, Ulcers, Tumours, Burns,
  Contusions, Fractures, and Chilblains, and is also laid upon the
  Cauteries. If you mingle with it the third or fourth part of its weight
  of some convenient Oil, it will attain to the Consistence of a Cerate;
  and this is that which is call'd <i>Dissolved Diapalma</i> or <i>Cerate
  of Diapalma</i>.</p>

<h3><i>The Plaister of simple </i>Diachylum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take of Marsh-Mallow-Roots peel'd, three Drams; the Seeds of Line and
  Fenugreek, of each four Ounces; three Quarts of Spring-Water; two Quarts
  of common Oil, and two Pounds of Litharge of Gold.</p>

  <p>Let the Mucilages of Marsh-Mallow-Roots, and of the Seeds of Line and
  Fenugreek be taken, as hath been shewn in the making of <i>Unguentum
  Althææ</i>, and let the Litharge be prepar'd after the same manner as for
  the Plaister of <i>Diapalma</i>. Having at first well mixt the Oil with
  the Litharge in a large Copper-Vessel or Pan, Tinn'd on the inside, being
  wide at the top, and tapering like a Cone toward the bottom, as also
  having afterward added and well incorporated the Mucilages, a moderate
  <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page330"></a>{330}</span>Charcoal Fire is to be kindl'd in a
  Furnace, upon which the Vessel is to be set, and the whole Mass is to be
  stirr'd about incessantly with a Wooden <i>Spatula</i>; and as fast as is
  possible. A gentle Fire is to be maintain'd, and the Boiling and
  Agitation to be continu'd, till it be perceiv'd that the Plaister begins
  to sink in the Pan; then the Heat of the Fire must be diminish'd one half
  at the least; and it will be requisite only to cause an Evaporation by
  little and little, of the Superfluous Moisture that might remain in the
  plaister, which being consum'd, it will be sufficiently boil'd, having
  attain'd to its due Consistence and Whiteness.</p>

  <p>This Plaister softens and dissolves hard Swellings, and even the
  Scirrhous Tumours of the Liver and Bowels; such are the Scrophulous or
  King's-Evil Tumours, the old remains of Abcesses, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3><i>The Plaister of </i>Andreas Crucius<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take two Ounces of Rosin; four Ounces of Gum <i>Elemi</i>,
  <i>Venice</i> Turpentine and Oil of Bays, of each two Ounces.</p>

  <p>After having beat in pieces the Rosin and Gum <i>Elemi</i>, they are
  to be melted together over a very gentle Fire, and then may be added the
  Turpentine and Oil of Bays. When the whole Mass hath been by this means
  well incorporated, it must be strain'd thro' a Cloth, to separate it from
  the Dregs. The Plaister being afterward cool'd, is to be made up in
  Rolls, and kept for use.</p>

<p><!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span></p>

  <p>This Plaister is proper for Wounds of the Breast: It also mundifies
  and consolidates all sorts of Wounds and Ulcers, dissipates Contusions,
  strengthens the Parts in Fractures and Dislocations, and causeth the
  Serous Humours to pass away by Transpiration.</p>

<h3>Emplastrum Divinum<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take of Litharge of Gold prepar'd, one Pound and an half; three Pints
  of common Oil; one Quart of Spring-Water; six Ounces of prepar'd
  Load-Stone; Gum <i>Ammoniack</i>, <i>Galbanum</i>, <i>Opoponax</i>, and
  <i>Bdellium</i>, of each three Ounces; Myrrh, <i>Olibanum</i>, Mastick,
  Verdegrease, and round Birth-Wort, of every one of these an Ounce and an
  half; eight Ounces of Yellow Wax, and four Ounces of Turpentine.</p>

  <p>Let the Gum <i>Ammoniack</i>, <i>Galbanum</i>, <i>Bdellium</i>, and
  <i>Opopanax</i> be dissolv'd in Vinegar, in a little Earthen Pipkin;
  strain 'em thro' a course Cloth, and let 'em be thicken'd by Evaporation,
  according to the Method before observ'd in other Plaisters: Then prepare
  the Load-Stone upon a Porphyry or Marble-Stone, and take care to bruise
  separately, the <i>Olibanum</i>, the Mastick, the Myrrh, the round
  Birth-Wort, and the Verdegrease, which is to be kept to be added at last.
  In the mean while, having incorporated cold the Oil with the Litharge,
  and mingl'd the Water with 'em, they are to be boil'd together over a
  very good Fire, stirring 'em incessantly, till the whole Composition hath
  aquir'd the Consistence of a somewhat solid <!-- Page 332 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>Plaister, in which is
  to be dissolv'd the yellow Wax cut into small pieces. Afterward having
  taken off the Pan from the Fire, and left the Ingredients to be half
  cool'd, intermix the Gums, which have been already thicken'd and
  incorporated with the Turpentine; then the Load-Stone mingl'd with the
  Birth-Wort, Myrrh, Mastick, and <i>Olibanum</i>; and last of all the
  Verdegrease. Thus when all these Ingredients are well stirr'd and mixt
  together, the Plaister will be entirely compounded; so that it may be
  made up into Rolls, and preserv'd to be us'd upon necessary
  Occasions.</p>

  <p>This Plaister is efficacious in curing of all kinds of Wounds, Ulcers,
  Tumours, and Contusions; for it mollifies, digestes, and brings to
  Suppuration such Matter as ought to be carry'd off this way. It also
  mundifies, cicatrizes, and entirely consolidates Wounds,

<h3><i>Of Cataplasms or Pultisses.</i></h3>

  <p>Cataplasms are usually prepar'd to asswage Pain; as also to dissolve
  and dissipate recent Tumours, and are made thus:</p>

  <p>Take four Ounces and a half of white Bread, one Pint of new Milk,
  three Yolks of Eggs, one Ounce of Oil of Roses, one Dram of Saffron, and
  two Drams of the Extract of <i>Opium</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>{333}</span></p>

  <p>The Crum is to be taken out of the inside of a white Loaf newly drawn
  out of the Oven, and to be boil'd with the Milk in a Skillet over a
  little Fire, stirring it from time to time with a <i>Spatula</i>, till it
  be reduc'd to a thick Pap. After having taken the Vessel off from the
  Fire, the three Yolks of Eggs beaten are to be put into it, and the Dram
  of Saffron pulveriz'd; to these Ingredients may be added two Drams of the
  Extract of <i>Opium</i> somewhat liquid, if the Pain be great.</p>

<h3><i>Here is another Cataplasm proper to mollifie
and to bring to Suppuration when it
is necessary.</i></h3>

  <p>Take White-Lilly-Roots, and Marsh-Mallow-Roots, of each four Ounces;
  the Leaves of common Mallows, Marsh-Mallows, Groundsel, Violet-Plants,
  Brank-Ursin, of every one of these Herbs one handful; the Meal of Line,
  Fenugreek, and Oil of Lillies, of each three Ounces.</p>

  <p>The Roots when wash'd and slic'd, are to be boil'd in Water, and the
  Leaves being added some time after, the Boiling is to be continu'd till
  the whole Mass becomes perfectly tender and soft; at which time having
  strain'd the Decoction, beat the remaining gross Substance in a
  Stone-Mortar, with a Wooden Pestle, and pass the Pulp thro' a Hair-Sieve
  turn'd upside-down: Then let the Decoction and Pulp so strain'd be put
  into a Skillet, and having intermixt the Meal of Line, Fenugreek, <!--
  Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>{334}</span>and
  Oil of Lillies; let 'em be boil'd together over a gentle Fire, stirring
  about the Ingredients from time to time, till they be all sufficiently
  thicken'd. These two Cataplasms may serve as a Model for the making of
  many others.</p>

<h3><i>Of Oils.</i></h3>

  <p>Oils are made either by Infusion or Expression.</p>

<h3><i>Simple Oil of Roses made by Infusion.</i></h3>

  <p>Take two Pounds of Roses newly gather'd, and bruis'd in a Mortar; half
  a Pint of the Juice of Roses, and five Pints of common Oil: Let the whole
  Composition be put into a Earthen-Vessel, Leaded and well stopt, and then
  let it be expos'd to the Sun during forty Days. Afterward let it be
  boil'd in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>; and having strain'd and squeez'd the
  Roses, let the Oil be kept for use.</p>

<h3><i>Compound Oil of Roses made by Infusion.</i></h3>

  <p>Take a Pound of Red Roses newly gather'd, and pound 'em in a Mortar;
  as also four Ounces of the Juice of Red Roses, and two Quarts of common
  Oil. Let the whole Composition be put into an Earthen-Vessel Leaded, the
  Mouth <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span>of which is narrow, and well stopt; and
  then having expos'd it to the Sun during four Days, let it be set in
  <i>Balneo Mariæ</i> for an Hour, and then strain'd and squeez'd.
  Afterward let this Liquor be put into the same Vessel, adding to it the
  Juice of Roses, and Roses themselves, in the same quantity as before: Let
  the Vessel be stopt; let the Maceration, Boiling, Straining, and
  Expression be made in like manner as before; and let the same Operation
  be once more re-iterated: Then let your Oil be depurated, and preserv'd
  for use.</p>

  <p>These Oils qualifie and disperse Defluctions of Humours, suppress
  Inflammations, mitigate the Head-ach and <i>Deliriums</i>, and provoke to
  sleep. They must be warm'd before the Parts are anointed with 'em, and
  they may be given inwardly against the Bloody-flux and Worms, the Dose
  being from half an Ounce to a whole Ounce. The Parts are also anointed
  with 'em in Fractures and Dislocations of the Bones, and <i>Oxyrodins</i>
  are made of 'em with an equal quantity of Vinegar of Roses.</p>

<h3><i>Oil of Sweet Almonds made by Expression.</i></h3>

  <p>Take new Almonds that are fat and very dry, without their Shells, and
  having shaken 'em in a somewhat thick Sieve, to cause the Dust to fall
  off; let 'em be put into hot Water till their Skins become tender, so
  that they may be separated by squeezing 'em with the Fingers: Afterward
  having taken off the Skin, they must be wip'd with a white Linnen-Cloth,
  and spread upon it to be dry'd: Then they are <!-- Page 336 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>to be put into a
  Stone-Mortar, and pounded with a Wooden-Pestle, till the Paste grows very
  thin, and begins to give Oil: This Paste is to be put into a little
  Linnen-Bag, new and strong, the Mouth of which hath been well ty'd; and
  the Bag is to be plac'd between two Platines of Tin, or of Wood lin'd on
  the inside with a Leaf of Tin, squeezing the whole Mass gently at first;
  but afterward very strongly, and leaving it for a long while in the
  Press, that the Oil may have time to run out.</p>

  <p>This Oil mitigates the Nephritick Colicks, remedies the Retention of
  Urine, facilitates Child-birth, allayes the After-Pains in Women after
  their delivery, and the Gripes in young Infants: It is taken inwardly
  fasting from half an Ounce to two Ounces; and it is us'd in Liniments to
  asswage and mollifie. The Oils of common Wall-Nuts and Small-Nuts, may be
  also prepar'd after the same manner as that of Sweet-Almonds.</p>

<h3><i>The Oil of Bayes.</i></h3>

  <p>Take as much as you please of Laurel or Bay-Berries, well cleans'd,
  perfectly ripe, and soundly bruis'd; let 'em be put into a Kettle, and
  boil'd with a sufficient quantity of Water during half an Hour; then
  strain and squeeze 'em strongly; let the Liquor cool, and scum off the
  Fat that swims upon the Water: Afterward pound the remaining Substance in
  a Mortar, and cause it to be boil'd again for half an Hour, with some of
  the first Water which was left, adding a little fresh; then strain and
  squeez it, <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page337"></a>{337}</span>as before, and take off the Oil that swims
  on the Top. But the first Oil is better than the second, and therefore
  ought to be kept separately. The Oils of Berries of Mastick, Myrtle, and
  other oleaginous Plants, may be extracted after the same manner.</p>

  <p>The Oil of Bayes mollifies, attenuates, and is opening and discussive:
  It is very good against the Palsie, and the Shiverings or cold Fits of a
  feaver or Ague in anointing the Back; as also against Scabs, Tetters,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3><i>The Oil of Eggs by Expression.</i></h3>

  <p>Take newly laid Eggs, and let 'em be harden'd in Water; then separate
  the Yolks, and put 'em into a Frying-pan over a gentle Coal-fire,
  stirring 'em about from time to time, and at last without discontinuing,
  till they grow reddish, and begin to yield their Oil: Then they are to be
  sprinkl'd with Spirit of Wine, and pour'd very hot into a little
  Linnen-Bag, which is to be ty'd, and set in a Press between two heated
  Platines; so that the Oil may be squeez'd out as readily as is
  possible.</p>

  <p>This Oil mitigates the Pains of the Ears and Hæmorrhoids, cures Scabs
  and Ring-Worms or Tetters; as also Chaps and Clefts in the Breast, Hands,
  Feet, and Fundament; and is made use of in Burns, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  of Roses, two Drams of <i>Orpiment</i>, one Dram of Verdegrease; Myrrh
  and Aloes, of each two Scruples.</p>

  <p>The <i>Orpiment</i>, Verdegrease, Myrrh, and Aloes are to be beaten to
  a fine Powder before they are intermixt with the Liquors. This
  <i>Collyrium</i> is not only good for the Eyes, but is also of use to
  make Injections into the Privy-Parts of Men and Women; but before the
  Injections are made, it ought to be sweeten'd with three or four times
  the quantity in weight of Rose, Plantain, or Morel-Water.</p>

<h3><i>A dry </i>Collyrium<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Take two Drams of Sugar-candy; prepar'd Tutty, Lizard's-Dung, of each

  half a Dram.</p>

  <p>Let the whole Composition be reduc'd to a very fine Powder, and mixt
  together: Two or three Grains of this Powder may be blown at <!-- Page
  339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span>once into
  the Eye with a small Quill, Pipe of Straw, or Reed, as long as it is
